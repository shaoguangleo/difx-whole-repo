    <h1>Overview of the DiFX GUI</h1>
    The DiFX GUI was developed at the United State Naval Observatory as
    a front end to the DiFX software correlator.&nbsp; It was designed
    to minimize the effort required to conduct "normal" correlation
    tasks without crippling the flexibility sophisticated operators
    require for unique or unusual operations.&nbsp; While it was
    designed to make running the correlator easier, running the GUI (and
    reading this documentation) requires some understanding of DiFX and
    its components.<br>
    <ul>

    <h3><a name="WHAT_IT_DOES"></a>What the GUI Does<br>
    </h3>
    The USNO GUI serves two purposes:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">DiFX Cluster Monitor</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI monitors and displays the
      health and activity of DiFX cluster components (processors, Mark5
      units, etc) and shows the progress of DiFX jobs running on the
      cluster.&nbsp; In this capacity it is essentially a passive
      observer, serving as a somewhat more colorful replacement to the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">errormon</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">mk5mon</span> and <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cpumon</span> scripts that come with
      DiFX.<br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Experiment/Job Administrator</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI can also be used to create
      runnable jobs from "raw" data - scans and<span style="font-family:
        Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span> .vex file content.&nbsp;
      Files required to run DiFX and directories for data products are
      all created according to user specifications, and jobs are
      organized in "Experiments" and "Passes", all of which can be
      stored using a database.&nbsp; The GUI can then instruct DiFX to
      process these jobs, and will then monitor their progress and data
      products in detail.<br>
    </p>
    The GUI can also be used to perform some of the maintenance tasks
    associated with software correlators.<br>
