COMMAND NAME:   fplot

SYNOPSIS:  Displays fringe plots attached to type 2 files

SYNTAX:    fplot [-x] [-d template] [-h] [-l] [-m level] [data file list]
               All option flags must appear before the data file list.
               The -x, -d, -h and -l flags are mutually exclusive, and
               enable xwindow display, diskfile, and hardcopy and
               line printer display mechinisms respectively.  The default
               is to display the plots with gs according to the GS_DEVICE
               environment variable.

OPTION FLAGS:	-x
			Display the fringe plot(s) on the X-window display
			pointed to by the DISPLAY environment variable.
		-d template
                        Saves the fringe plots(s) using the template name.
                        With more than one plot, %d should appear in this
                        template name so that unique files are generated.
		-h
			Print a hardcopy of the fringe plot(s), via
                        the print utility pprint_plot
                -l
			Print a hardcopy of the fringe plot(s), via lpr
                -m level
                        Change the verbosity level of the program.  The
                        default is 2, and a lower value may produce more
                        commentary.

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			A list of type-2 files, the fringe plots of which
			to display or print.  Fplot follows the standard 
			MkIV data file specification format.
			You may specify individual type-2 filenames,
			scan directories which contain data files,
			experiment directories, or any combination of
			these three.  In the latter two cases,
			fplot will descend the directory tree looking for
			data files to add to its internal list of files to
			process.  Beware of trying to specify too many
			files or scan directories, as it is possible to
			overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
			experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
			directory instead.

ENVIRONMENT:	MK4_PRINTER, PRINTER, GS_DEVICE, GS_OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION:

This program is designed to allow easy access to the fringe plots attached
to the type-2 files on disk, by FRNGE or fourfit.  Using the standard data
file specification format for MkIV programs, one can generate a selective
list of files to display or print.  The -x option displays the plots on
an Xwindow screen, and has the virtue of great speed.  One can flip through
many fringe plots very rapidly, and move both backwards and forwards in the
list of files to be displayed.  This capability is intended to save trees.

For those who need hardcopy printout, the -h option is provided.  The
plot is spooled using the "lpr" print spooler to an appropriate printer
identified by the support script "pplot_print".  (PRINTER takes precedence
over MK4_PRINTER unless you've redefined MK4_PRINTER from its default.  And
in any case you can put your own pplot_print script earlier in your PATH to
do what you like.)  The -l option bypasses any pplot_print script in your
path and spools the plot to your default printer directly.

The -d option allows you to extract the postscript plots from the Type-2
fringe files and save them to disk.  In this case the template filename
should include %d so that multiple plots are placed in multiple files (with
%d being replaced by the ordinal number of the plot sequence).

If no plotting options are specified, the default behavior is the same as
for with the -x option.  However, the postscript is interpreted by the
ghostscript interpreter (gs) and that program modifies its behavior in
response to GS_* environment variables.  In any case, you should consult
the documentation for ghostscript for complete details for your system.
For example, however, you can make a set of JPEG plots via

    GS_OPTIONS=-sOutputFile=abc%02d.jpg GS_DEVICE=jpeg fplot files ....

This display mechanism (as with -x) pauses after each plot looking for 
input:

    h for a hardcopy (via pprint_plot)
    p to return to the previous plot
    n for the next plot
    s to save the plot (with the name you provide)
    q to quit
    otherwise to continue with the next plot
