* Allow ".input" portion of input file to be optional
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

3.2.0
* Now the DifxIF structures are _always_ set to be USB.  This will break compatibility with earlier versions of difx2fits and maybe difx2mark4.
* Add DIFX LABEL to .calc file
* Tcal requests will now return values outside sampled range, but will cause warning at end of processing.
* Support RX NAME parameter in FREQ table
* Experimental support for TLE spacecraft ephemerides
* Some segfault protecting in model writing (CJP+WFB)
* Experimental support for polarization dependent delay and phase offsets (CJP)
* Version for DiFX-2.2, May 31, 2013

3.1.0
* Rename from 3.0.2 prior to DiFX-2.1
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 4, 2012

3.0.2
* Post DiFX-2.0.1
* Infrastructure for az, el, parallactic angle in model added
* Tcal managing structures and functions added
* Bug fix: simplifyDifxRules: allow number of rules to go to zero
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 4, 2012

3.0.1
* Post DiFX-2.0.0
* All string parameters of difx_input have parameterized lengths
* Get rid of strcpy and strncpy in favor of more friendly snprintf
* Add optional VEX FILE parameter to .calc file
* Introduce new enum SamplingType 
* Add infrastructure for tcalFrequency
* Add DifxStringArray, which will be used for storing scan names and source names in DifxRule blocks
* Clean up, a little bit, the low level writing routines
* Considerable fixes to zoom band support
* Add Remap[] arrays inside DifxJob to account for pre-merged array indices
* Add some accessor functions to return a list of datastreams associated with an antenna.  This will be used to allow multiple datastreams per antenna.
* Add infrastructure to make redhat .rpm file
* Three fixes for ephemeris driven objects: EARTH -> EARTH BARYCENTER to match changed spice nomenclature, move to linear interpolation, and actually link to spacecraft table from source table
* Version for DiFX-2.0.1, Jun 10, 2011 / updated June 16

3.0
* Includes the following changes merged (hopefully correctly) from the DiFX-1.5 branch;
  - Merge fixes from trunk
  - Add network table infrastructure
  - Load > 1 pulsar polynomial from a file
  - Move flags to DifxJob so combinig multiple subarrays results in accurate
    application of flags.  NOTE: This breaks the API
  - Infrastructure for writing for file-based correlation
  - When sorting antennas, update the scan table (nAntenna, im and model)
  - Fix and simplify DifxInputGetScanIdByAntennaId
  - Fix for parsing of .flag file. 
  - Start some infrastructure for supporting proper flagging in cases of partially
    overlapping scans
  - Add difxcalculator under utils.  This is an implementation of
    http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/difx/difx_calculator.xls
    as a stand-alone program
* Allows support of multiple phase centres in input/calc/im files
* Allows support of zoom bands
* Replaces blockspersend with subintNS
* Shifts numchannels/oversample/decimation etc from Configuration to Freq
* Allows use of Rule table in input file
* Adds support for LO offsets
* Fix memory leak (need to free baseline array)
* Print all spacecraft entries, not just for the first spacecraft
* Prevent merging of jobs that have incompatible clocks
* Change to polynomial-based clock model (up to 5th order)
* Move all data source information to DifxDatastream where it should be
* Respect and track all filenames rather than assume systematically named files
* rename all recChan variables to recBand for better uniformity
* remove baselineFreq2IF array which was complex and wrong and not needed
* RCFreqId was used with two meanings (that usually gave the same value).
  The true usage is now used everywhere. (Thanks to Randall Wayth for helping find this in DiFX 1.5!)
* Precision in source positions increased by two digits, now matches the 1.5 branch
* Rounding error fixed when mjdStart/Stop manually specified
* Track vex filename
* free rule array when deleting difxinput objects
* don't write out unused rules to input file
* bugfix preventing crash during job concatenation when number of antennas changes downwards
* Version for DiFX-2.0.0

2.11
* Post DiFX-1.5
* Implement profile mode (with mode=profile at the global level)
* Add writeDifxLineBoolean and use it for writing TRUE/FALSE values

2.10
* Deallocation option of function DifxBaselineAllocPolProds()
  - needed for more flexible frequency selection in vex2difx
* Consider antenna reordering when concattenating scans
* use same mjd rounding for .calc and .input files
* Version for DiFX-1.5

2.9
* Initial support for calculation of spacecraft positions via SPICE

2.8
* Version bump for slight API change
* padDifxScans added to allow extra non-correlation scans to be inserted

2.7
* Version bump for slight API change
* a few important bug fixes
* Add simplify functions for freqs, datastreams, baselines and configs
* separate out internal deallocation from table destructors and force to 0 deallocated arrays

2.6
* Version bump.  Slight change to internal API.  This version is needed for pulsar
  support in vex2difx.

2.5
* Version bump.  This version required now by vex2difx.

2.4 
* Post NRAO-DiFX 1.1 developments
* Ability to write .calc and .input files
