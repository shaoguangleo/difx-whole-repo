COMMAND NAME:	nfreq

TYPE:		Data selection

SYNTAX:	  e.g.	"nfreq >= 8"
	    or	"nfreq < 2"

DESCRIPTION:

Sets the number of frequencies processed for this scan which
will pass the filtering functions applied in read, edit, and
plot.  The syntax is quite forgiving.  The requirements are
that there be an optional inequality operator, possibly followed 
by an equals sign, followed by a sensible number.  Spaces are 
irrelevant.  If the inequality is omitted, exactly the specified
number of frequencies must be present to pass the filters.

If "nfreq" is typed with no arguments, or with just "0" as an 
argument, all restrictions on the number of frequencies 
processed are removed.
