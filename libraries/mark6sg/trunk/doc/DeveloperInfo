This is a very brief overview of the library functions.

This library provides a level of abstraction over VLBI scan data
recorded in SG (scatter-gather) mode with the Mark6 software.
The library functions gather the scattered pieces of scan data and 
provide access to it via standard VFS-like functions (e.g., open, read).

Include:         #include <mark6sg.h> 
Dynamic link:    LDLIBS=-lmark6sg     or link against   libmark6sg.la
Static link:     LDLIBS=libmark6sg.a  

The VFS-like interface is

  mark6_sg_open()     only read-only
  mark6_sg_creat()    only write-only and exclusive
  mark6_sg_close()
  mark6_sg_lseek()
  mark6_sg_read()
  mark6_sg_write()
  mark6_sg_fstat()

Configuration functions are

  mark6_sg_get_rootpattern()
  mark6_sg_set_rootpattern()

Convenience functions are

  mark6_sg_verbositylevel()
  mark6_sg_packetsize()
  mark6_sg_packetsize_hint()
  mark6_sg_stripesize()

  mark6_sg_list_all_scans()

To keep the implementation simple the functions are not thread-safe
and the external use of mutexes may be required if your program is threaded.

The current interface is C only, not C++.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of the VFS-like functions

C: int fd = mark6_sg_open(scanname, O_RDONLY);

  Opens the set of files associated with the given scan.
  This involves a metadata extraction pass across all these files
  and may a few seconds, depending on the total length of the scan.

C: mark6_sg_close(fd);

  Closes the file descriptor. Carries out some internal clean-up.

C: off_t newoff = mark6_sg_lseek(fd, (off_t)offset, SEEK_SET/*or other*/);

  Changes the current read offset.

C: size_t nread = mark6_sg_read(fd, (void*)buf, (size_t)nrequested);

  Reads data from the scan.
  The data are gathered from the individual files of the scan.
  No restrictions on read size or byte alignment.

C: struct stat st;
C: mark6_sg_fstat(fd, &st);

  Returns the 'stat' information on the opened file. See 'man 2 fstat'.
  Note that 
    st_size     : total size in bytes of the entire scan
    st_blksize  : packet size that the Mark6 software thought it was recording
    time fields : time infos of the first file, *not* VLBI data timestamps

  For VLBI data time stamps, the user application must decode the
  scan data returned with read(). Usually Mark6 software is used to capture
  10 GbE network data streams that contain data in VDIF format.

C: int fd = mark6_sg_creat(scanname, ignored_mode);

  Creates a new scan i.e. new set of fragment files for the given scanname.

  Utilizes the Mark6 scatter-gather disk root pattern (cf. mark6_sg_set_rootpattern())
  to determine the paths of the fragment file to create.

  If any fragment file(s) already exist for the given scan name, the function
  returns an error i.e. the behaviour is like open(...,O_CREAT|O_TRUNC|O_EXCL).

  The new scan is NOT added into Mark6 JSON metadata.

C: ssize_t nwritten = mark6_sg_write(fd, (void*)srcbuf, (size_t)nbytes);

  Writes a user specified buffer into the scan.

  Internally the default maximum scatter-gather block size is 5000 frames
  and a default assumed frame size of 10032 byte. Write size 'nbytes' must
  not be larger than this.

  During the write to disk of the very first scatter-gather block the
  function will inspect the block once (VDIF frames assumed!) to determine
  the actual frame size and to adjust the Mark6 headers accordingly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of the configuration functions

C: const char* rp = mark6_sg_get_rootpattern();

  Returns the current internal search path for mount points,
  the default is "/mnt/disks/[1-4]/[0-7]/"

C: char* rp = mark6_sg_set_rootpattern(const char* new_sg_root_pattern);
 
  Specifies a new root pattern. Takes effect on the next open(), creat(),
  and mark6_sg_list_all_scans().

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of the convenience functions

C: mark6_sg_verbositylevel(0);

  Changes the verbosity or printout level,
  0=none, 1=little, 2=debug, 3=more debug

C: int packetsize = mark6_sg_packetsize(fd);

  Returns the packet size that the Mark6 software thought it was recording.
  Here 'fd' is the file descriptor of a scan opened with mark6_sg_open().

C: int mark6_sg_packetsize_hint((size_t)nbyte);

  Sets the default assumed packet size.
  Use this prior to opening any new scan for writing.

c: size_t stripesize = mark6_sg_stripesize(fd);

  Returns the stripe size ("block size"), not counting extra Mark6 metadata,
  of the first block of a recording. Does not check for a variable block size.
  Here 'fd' is the file descriptor of a scan opened with mark6_sg_open().

C: char** uniquenamelist;
C: int nscans = mark6_sg_list_all_scans(&uniquenamelist);

  Allocates space in the string array 'uniquenamelist'
  and adds all scans found under the currently set root pattern (default
  is "/mnt/disks/[1-2]/[0-7]/*") to this string array.

  Scan names can be used in the call to "open()".

  The user application must free() the uniquenamelist[0..nscans-1]
  entries and free() uniquenamelist[] when no longer used.
