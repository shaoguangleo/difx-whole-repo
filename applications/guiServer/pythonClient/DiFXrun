#
#\brief Run a list of jobs on the DiFX server with limited controls.
#
#  Usage:  <b><code>DiFXrun [options] [.input path list]</code></b>
#
#  <i>DiFXrun</i> runs a list of DiFX jobs, specified by <code>.input</code> file paths, on a DiFX cluster.  
#  By default it tries to distribute the jobs on the cluster in a reasonable way such that the cluster will not
#  be overwhelmed, or it will do so based on
#  user command-line settings (reasonable or otherwise).  Jobs are distributed amongst
#  existing DiFX cluster processors by actively altering the .machines and .threads files associated
#  with them.  There are three basic
#  "modes" of operation:
#
#  <h3>Scheduler Mode (Default)</h3>
#
#  By default <i>DiFXrun</i> runs a primitive scheduler.  It attempts to assign
#  a number of processor nodes to each job (by default this number is 2 - it can
#  be set with the "-p" command-line option) before running them.  It will continue to do this
#  until it runs out of jobs (in which case it is done), or until it runs out of processors.
#  When the latter happens <i>DiFXrun</i> will wait to start any remaining jobs until sufficient
#  allocated resources are freed as previous jobs complete.
#
#  <center>![DiFXrun running a series of jobs in scheduler mode (6 processors used for each).](DiFXrun_default.png)</center>
#
#  <h3>Sequential Mode</h3>
#
#  In sequential mode (selected by the command-line option "-s"), <i>DiFXrun</i> will run only one job at a time
#  until all are done.  Two processing nodes will be used on each job unless
#  otherwise requested using the "-p" option.
#
#  <center>![DiFXrun running a series of jobs in sequential mode (6 processors used for each).](DiFXrun_sequential.png)</center>
#
#  <h3>"All" Mode</h3>
#
#  If the "-a" command line option is used (for "all" mode), <i>DiFXrun</i> will simultaneously run
#  all jobs listed using all available processors.  This works okay and might be the fastest way to run a limited list
#  of jobs but breaks down rapidly as the list gets long.  Remember, if you use this option you are starting
#  all listed jobs <i>at the same time</i>.  
#
#  <center>![DiFXrun running a series of jobs simultaneously in \"all\" mode (all processors employed).](DiFXrun_all.png)</center>
#
#  In all cases <i>DiFXrun</i> applies all available processor threads to each job
#  being run on a processor (the number of threads comes from the number of "cores" of each
#  machine).  Machines assigned as data sources will be treated as regular
#  processors - no accommodation is made for the load put on a machine by its being
#  a data source (experience has shown this to be an acceptable assumption).  The
#  "head node" is also treated as a processor.
#
#  The list of <code>.input</code> files that will be run is specified using a
#  regular expression, and needs to include the full path to the files.  
#  Matching <code>.input</code> files actually located on the server will be run.
#  Because of the infinite possible matches that can occur with regular expressions
#  (depending on how you word them),
#  no warnings will be given about "missing" <code>.input</code> files (file names that
#  match the regular expression but do not exist).
#
#  To detect processors, <i>DiFXrun</i> depends on <i>mk5daemon</i> being run on each.
#  If <i>mk5daemon</i> is missing on a processor, <i>DiFXrun</i> will simply never see
#  it, and will be unable to utilize it.
#
#  <h3>Feedback</h3>
#
#  For each job it runs, <i>DiFXrun</i> provides a text-based "progress bar", as well as a
#  status and completion percentage.  In addition, a node-usage map shows which processors
#  a job is currently using (the "*" character), which processors it used (the "O" character),
#  and which processors it did not touch (the "." character).  The nodes in the node-usage
#  map are sorted by name, but nodes are chosen for processing in the order messages are
#  received from them, so the nodes used for a job will often be scattered about the map.
#
#  All of these displays are updated when new job-related information is received.
#
#  <h4>If A Job Stops Responding</h4>
#
#  There are myriad (and sometimes unknown) reasons why a DiFX job might stop or stop
#  sending feedback.  To avoid having <i>DiFXrun</i> hang forever on a job that will
#  never report completion, failure, or whatever hung state it is in, a timeout scheme
#  is implemented.  When a job has been silent for a timeout interval (you can set the
#  interval using the -t argument, by default it is 300 seconds), its state will be
#  reported as "Not Responding" and an effort will be made to shut the job, or whatever
#  is left of the job down on the server (using aggressive kill signals).
#
#  <h3>What If I Want To Share the Correlator?</h3>
#
#  <i>DiFXrun</i> assumes that it has the entire correlator to itself, so that any processor
#  it detects it will try to use for correlating jobs.  You can, however, block processors
#  by name, and thus utilize only a portion of the correlator.  To do this, use the "-e"
#  option, and list the node names you do not wish to use using a regular expression.  If
#  two or more parties agree on named blocks of processors that are allocated to them
#  (and more importantly which ones are NOT allocated to them), they can use this option
#  to keep multiple sessions of <i>DiFXrun</i> from stepping
#  on one another.

#                                                          displayed.

#                                                          will be blindly used in the order they are specified.

#                                                          be used.  Failing that, "DIFX-DEVEL" will be used.
