    This document contains an end-to-end description of how the DiFX
    user
    interface can be used to run DiFX jobs.&nbsp; All steps in the
    process
    are described in roughly the sequence they would be employed in
    actually running a job.&nbsp; Because the GUI has many options that
    can
    cause branching paths in step-by-step instructions, what follows is
    only a description of a "sample" procedure for running a job.&nbsp;
    The
    specific needs of individual users, data and installations will
    likely
    require approaches that differ some, or possibly a lot.&nbsp; With
    this
    in mind, links are provided to other sections of the documentation
    that
    may provide additional details on each subject.<br>
    <br>
    This document is <i>not</i> a comprehensive tutorial on all of the
    functionality of DiFX itself.&nbsp; A good place to start looking
    for
    that sort of thing is <a
      href="http://cira.ivec.org/docuwiki/doku.php/difx/start">here</a>.<br>
    <h3><a name="Install and Build"></a>Install and Build</h3>
    The DiFX GUI and its associated client process <i>guiServer</i> are
    part of the DiFX software tree.&nbsp; , currently located in the
    sub-directory:<br>
    <pre><tt>	applications/gui</tt></pre>
    <a name="dist_directory"></a>The Java archive (".jar") file used to
    run the GUI itself is in:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/gui/dist/gui.jar<br></pre>
    This directory also contains a number of other ".jar" files that are
    necessary to run the GUI.&nbsp; If you want to move the GUI to
    another disk location it is best to simply copy the complete
    contents of the "dist" directory.<br>
    <br>
    The top-level of this documentation is here:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/doc/intro.html<br></pre>
    The guiServer application is also part of the DiFX software tree,
    in:<br>
    <pre>	application/guiServer<br></pre>
    Using DiFX build procedures (such as <a
      href="https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/HPC/UsnoDifxInstallation"><i>difxbuild</i></a>)
    will compile <i>guiServer</i> and install it and gui.jar file in
    the appropriate bin directories.&nbsp; The ".jar" files do not need
    compilation.
    <h3><a name="Startup"></a>Startup and Connecting to the DiFX Host</h3>
    There are two components to the DiFX GUI.&nbsp; A single instance of
    the server application <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    runs on one of the processing nodes in the DiFX cluster&nbsp; (the
    processor running <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    is often referred to in the documentation as the "DiFX Host" or
    the&nbsp; "DiFX head node").&nbsp; <i>GuiServer </i>must by run by
    a
    user (not root for security reasons) that has read/write permissions
    over all data directories used by DiFX.&nbsp; This user must also be
    able to start processes on all other nodes using <span
      style="font-style: italic;">mpirun.</span>&nbsp; It probably makes
    most sense to have the user that you normally use to run DiFX from
    the
    command line run <i>guiServer</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <i>GuiServer</i> is run from the command line on the DiFX Host:<br>
    <pre>	guiServer [PORT #]<br></pre>
    <a name="port_information"></a>The optional port number is the TCP
    connection port used to communicate
    with the GUI.&nbsp; If it is not specified, <i>guiServer</i> will
    use
    a default port number (it uses the value given by the
    DIFX_MESSAGE_PORT
    environment variable, or 50200 if that is not available).&nbsp; As
    soon
    as it is started, <i>guiServer</i> will produce a message
    indicating
    the port it is using:<br>
    <pre>	server at port 50200<br></pre>
    The GUI itself is a Java program that can be run anywhere that a
    network connection to the DiFX cluster is available.&nbsp; Because
    the
    GUI and <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    communicate
    using insecure TCP connections there must be no intervening
    firewalls
    between them (there are ways to deal with firewalls and in fact run
    the
    GUI anywhere - see <a
      href="how_to_run_things_content.html#Running_DiFX_Remotely">Running
DiFX
      Remotely</a>).&nbsp; Run the GUI using its ".jar" (Java archive)
    file:<br>
    <pre>	java -jar [GUI DIST PATH]/gui.jar<br></pre>
    The "GUI DIST PATH" is the location of the "dist" subdirectory in
    the
    gui portion of the DiFX installation tree (see <a
      href="#dist_directory">here</a>).&nbsp; Once the GUI is running,
    the address of the DiFX Host (where <span style="font-style:
      italic;">guiServer</span> is running) and the port
    number (what <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    told
    you above) can be entered in the Settings menu to connect the two
    (see <a
href="../../../../../../../../Users/johnspitzak/NetBeansProjects/doi/USNO/doc/settings_content.html#DiFX_Control_Connection">DiFX
Control
      Connection</a> in the Settings documentation for
    details).&nbsp; A proper connection will be pretty obvious - the <a
      href="main_window_content.html#GuiServer_Connection_Monitor">guiServer
      Connection Monitor</a> will turn green, a "connection successful"
    message will appear, and, assuming you have <a
      href="#Run_mk5daemon_"><i>mk5daemon</i></a> operating
    properly, the GUI should start displaying information about the
    components of the DiFX cluster.<br>
    <img alt="" src="images/how_to_run_things/connected_toplevel.png"
      height="658" width="1094">
    The GUI and <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> can
    be
    started in any order - the GUI will connect as soon as a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> becomes available
    (for the most part - <a href="#Order_Is_Maybe_Important">remote
      connections</a> are sometimes more touchy about this).&nbsp;
    Any number of GUI sessions can be run simultaneously using the same
    <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>, although there
    are considerations one should take into account to make sure ports
    are always available.<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
    <h5><a name="Run_mk5daemon_"></a>Run <span style="font-style:
        italic;">mk5daemon</span>!<br>
    </h5>
    <p>For the GUI to work properly it is important that the <i>mk5daemon</i>
      process be running on every DiFX hardware component (processors,
      MK5
      units, etc.) in the DiFX cluster.&nbsp; The reason for this is
      that <i>mk5daemon</i>
      produces the periodic "heartbeats" for each component, including
      such
      information as CPU and memory load and read/write
      operations.&nbsp; <i>Mk5daemon</i>
      is also important because it is the only way the GUI knows that a
      component exists and is available as a resource - without it the
      component will not be utilized in DiFX processing.&nbsp; Your DiFX
      cluster may be set up such that <span style="font-style: italic;">mk5daemon</span>
      is started by each component
      when it boots, but in the event it is not you will need to log
      into
      each component (use the DIFX_USER) and start it by typing:</p>
    <pre>	mk5daemon &amp;<br></pre>
    <p>Soon after <span style="font-style: italic;">mk5daemon</span> is
      run on a component, the component should
      appear in the GUI Hardware Monitor (see <a
        href="#Monitoring_the_DiFX_Cluster">Monitoring the DiFX Cluster</a>).</p>
    <p> It is possible to run DiFX using the GUI with <i>mk5daemon</i>
      absent on some or all components, but this is not a subject
      covered
      here.<b><i><br>
        </i></b></p>
    <h3><a name="Some_Important_Settings"></a>Some Important Settings</h3>
    <p>The GUI has many options the user can set to govern processing,
      how
      data are stored, and where necessary components are located.&nbsp;
      Most
      of these needn't be touched on a job-by-job basis as long as the
      GUI is
      running smoothly and appears to be doing things correctly.&nbsp;
      Below
      is a list of some of the settings that are more likely to require
      user
      changes (each item is linked to detailed explanations in the
      Settings Documentation).&nbsp; A comprehensive list of all
      settings and their options is
      contained in the <a href="settings_content.html">Settings
        Documentation</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="settings_content.html@DiFX_Host"><b>DiFX Host</b></a>
        is the host name of the "head node" of the DiFX cluster - where
        <i>guiServer</i> should be running.&nbsp; The DiFX host name
        should be whatever the machine on which the GUI is run calls the
        DiFX head node - i.e. a "ping" of this host name from the GUI
        host should be successful.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="settings_content.html#Control_Port"><b>Control Port</b></a>
        is the port number at which the GUI will repeatedly attempt to
        make a connection to guiServer if such a connection does not
        exist.&nbsp; The control port should match the <a
          href="port_information">port number</a> given by guiServer
        when it is started.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Run w/DiFX Version</b></li>
      <li><b>DiFX Execute Script<br>

      <li><b>Relay Using guiServer Connection</b></li>
      <li><a href="settings_content.html@Working_Directory"><b>Working
            Directory</b></a> is the path under which new directories
        are stored for DiFX experiments that the user creates using the
        GUI.&nbsp; The "user" running DiFX needs to have write
        permission in this location or none of this will work.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that settings are preserved between GUI sessions, so once
      you
      have things set up and running properly you should be able to
      restart
      the GUI and have it run properly right away.<br>

    <h5>The Contents of the Queue Browser</h5>
    <p>The Queue Browser is described in greater detail <a
        href="mainWindow_content.html#Queue_Browser">here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Queue Browser organizes DiFX jobs under a three-level
      hierarchy
      with "Experiments" at the top level.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <b>Experiment</b> is usually bound to a single data set
        (one
        or more scans) collected over a specific time span - the results
        of a
        single observing session for instance.&nbsp; It can contain any
        number
        of "Passes" (including zero).</li>
      <li>A <b>Pass</b> is used to contain a single analysis of a
        subset
        of the data.&nbsp; Often Experiments contain a "Clock Pass" run
        on a
        few scans to generate the time delays for each involved antenna,
        and a
        "Production Pass" run on all scans with those time delays in
        place.</li>
      <li>Within each Pass is a series of <b>Jobs</b>, each controlling
        the processing of at least one scan.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Adding Existing Experiments to the Queue Browser</h5>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Creating_a_New_Experiment"></a>Creating a New
      Experiment</h3>
    <p>To create a new experiment all that is required is a .vex file
      and
      appropriate data.&nbsp; The GUI will perform (or facilitate) the
      various steps required to set up an experiment for DiFX processing
      based on instructions from the user.&nbsp; In short, these steps
      amount
      to:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Setting up a location to do the processing</li>
      <li>Creating a .v2d file to go with the .vex file</li>
      <li>Running <i>vex2difx</i> and <i>calcif2</i> to create .input
        and
        .im files</li>
    </ol>
    The GUI tries to be as flexible as possible about this, although it
    has
    a "preferred" way of arranging things such that running DiFX
    processing
    on the created experiments is possible through the GUI as
    well.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To create a new experiment, select "Create New.." under the
    "Experiments" menu in the Queue Browser.<br>
    <b>IMAGE<br>
    </b>This will bring up the "Create New Experiment" window:<br>
    <b>IMAGE</b><br>
    The purpose of this window is to allow the user to tailor a new
    experiment to meet their needs.&nbsp; It creates a "working"
    directory
    for the new experiment, allows the specification of data sources,
    and
    puts all relevant DiFX files (<tt>.v2d</tt>, <tt>.input</tt>, etc.)
    in
    the working directory from which they can be run (either through the
    GUI or by hand).&nbsp; Experimentation with different GUI settings
    while creating an experiment is not dangerous as the original <tt>.vex</tt>
    file and data files are not moved or altered in any way.&nbsp; If
    you
    mess up, delete the experiment and try again.<br>
    <h4>Naming the New Experiment and Putting It Somewhere<br>
    </h4>
    <h4>Getting .vex File Content<br>
    </h4>
    <p>bleah<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Changing .vex File Content</h4>
    <p>Once you have obtained .vex data from some source, the data are
      displayed in the ".vex File Editor" panel.&nbsp; This panel
      provides a
      (rather rudimentary) text editor that can be used to edit the .vex
      data
      by hand.&nbsp; The final edited text is used in the .vex file
      assigned
      to your created experiment, a copy of which is put in your working
      directory.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Some care should be taken in directly editing .vex data as it is
      trivial to corrupt the .vex to the point where it can't be used
      (the
      DiFX operational paradigm says that users should never need to do
      this), but editing this content does not alter the original source
      .vex
      file, only the final .vex file associated with the experiment - so
      playing around with things is not permanently harmful.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Correlation Tuning Parameters</h4>
    <p>The Correlation Tuning Parameters section includes values that
      can
      be changed to adjust the quality of the correlation results,
      and/or the
      total time processing takes.&nbsp; Adjustments to many of these
      values
      is something of an art in itself, and the details of what things
      do and
      what their "best" values should be is not covered here (some talks
      at
      DiFX Users Meetings have covered the subject - slides can be
      viewed
      here).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each item has an associated "apply" check box.&nbsp; If this box
      is
      not checked, no instructions regarding the item will be put in the
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">.v2d</font> file and
      <i>vex2difx</i>
      will be allowed to pick its own defaults.&nbsp; <i>Unless you
        know
        what you are doing, don't check the apply box - let </i>vex2difx<i>
        pick the values!</i>&nbsp; The GUI has default values for all
      items but
      they are not based on anything - they are essentially
      placeholders.&nbsp; The default values that are picked by <i>vex2difx</i>
      are far better.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Stations and Data Sources</h4>
    <p>Each antenna involved in the observations described by the .vex
      data
      triggers the creation of a panel in the "Stations" section.&nbsp;
      The
      two-letter code station/antenna code is used as a panel title
      (associated with each station is a check box that can be used to
      eliminate the station from the experiment - see <a
        href="#Eliminating_Stations_in_the_Stations">below</a>).&nbsp;
      Each
      station panel contains four sub-sections: Data Source; Antenna;
      Site;
      and Settings.<br>
      <b>IMAGE OF A STATION PANEL<br>
      </b>In most cases users only make changes to the Settings and Data
      Source sections.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Source</h5>
    <p>The Data Source section tells DiFX where the data for a
      particular
      station/antenna can be found.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Because filling out the Data Source section can be tedious, the
      DiFX
      GUI provides a way of pre-defining all Data Source settings for a
      station/antenna in the Settings "Job Creation Settings" section
      (see <a href="settings_content.html#ANTENNA_DEFAULTS">Antenna
        Defaults</a>).<br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Settings</h5>
    <p>The Settings section contains settings for Tone, Phase
      Calibration
      Interval and Delta Clock.&nbsp; The Delta Clock value is often
      gleaned
      by running a "Clock Pass" on a subset of the experiment's data
      (see
      some sort of explanation here).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Selecting Specific Scans<br>
    </h4>
    When new .vex data are selected, the GUI begins with the assumption
    that all scans described in the data will be included in the new
    experiment.&nbsp; There are a number of ways of adjusting which
    scans
    are ultimately used, and which stations are used in which
    scans.&nbsp;
    These changes are reflected in the final .v2d and .vex files that
    are
    created as part of the new experiment.&nbsp; The "Scan Selection"
    Editor can be used at any time to view the scans that will be
    included
    in the experiment when it is created.<br>
    <b>IMAGE OF SCAN SELECTION EDITOR</b><br>
    <br>
    Some of the scan and station selection controls can work at
    cross-purposes - effectively they provide more than one way to cause
    a
    scan or a station to be used.&nbsp; When a conflict occurs, the GUI
    will give the most recent command precedence (if, for instance, a
    command is given that a scan be included in the final experiment
    when a
    previous command eliminated the scan, the GUI will include the
    scan).&nbsp; <br>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminating Stations in the "Source" .vex
      Data</h5>
    <p>Stations
      can be eliminated from individual scans by putting a "-1" in the
      "code"
      column within the appropriate "scan" section in the "source" .vex
      data.&nbsp; When the GUI encounters the "-1", it will remove the
      station from the scan.&nbsp; This duplicates hardware correlator
      behavior.&nbsp; Starting with the .vex file snippet below, the
      final
      .vex file will not include the station "Bd" because of the "-1" in
      the
      final column.<br>
    </p>
    <pre style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; scan 128-1703;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start = 2014y128d17h03m34s;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mode = GEOSX8N.8F;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source = 1846+322;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; station = Bd :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ft : 1A : &amp;n : -1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; station = Ho :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ft : 1A : &amp;n : 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; station = Kk :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ft : 1A : &amp;cw : 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; station = Ny :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ft : 1A : &amp;ccw : 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; station = Ts :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 sec :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 ft : 1A : &amp;cw : 1;<br>&nbsp; endscan;</pre>
    If you do not want the GUI to pay attention to the "-1" code in this
    way, un-check the <a
      href="settings_content.html#Eliminate_Stations_With_Code">Eliminate
Stations
      With "-1" Code</a> box in the Settings menu.<br>
    <h5><a name="Eliminating_Stations_in_the_Stations"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eliminating
      Stations in the "Stations" Section<br>
    </h5>
    <p>The "Stations" section is primarily set up to change parameters
      related to each antenna involved in an experiment, and to select
      the
      data sources associated with them (see above).&nbsp; However it
      also
      includes a check box that can be used to completely remove each
      station
      from the experiment. Any scans that no longer have enough stations
      to
      form a baseline (i.e. less than two) will be eliminated.&nbsp; <br>
      <b>IMAGE</b><br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Scan/Station Timeline" Editor</h5>
    <p>The "Scan/Station Timeline" section provides a visual map of all
      scans and the stations used in them in a timeline.&nbsp; It allows
      the
      selection/deselection of individual stations within scans or the

    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting by Source Using the "Sources"
      Editor<br>
    </h5>
    <p>The "Sources" section shows all sources and the stations used to
      observe them.&nbsp; It allows sources to be selected and
      deselected,
      and stations to be selectively used or eliminated from sources.<br>
      <b>IMAGE<br>
      </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>All sources included in the .vex file are listed.&nbsp; Boxes
        show which sources are observed with which stations.</li>
      <li>Hover over the name of a source to produce a tooltip that
        includes information about the source as well as the names of
        the scans
        used to observe it and the stations used for each of those scans
        (stations marked in red have been eliminated).</li>
      <li>Hover over the boxes to produce a tooltip that includes which
        scans use the associated station on the associated source.&nbsp;
        A scan
        that appears in red text has been eliminated - either explicitly
        or
        because it lacks sufficient stations to form a baseline.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Use check boxes to add or eliminate a source.&nbsp; When a
        source
        is removed, all scans associated with it are eliminated from the
        final
        experiment.&nbsp; When a source is added, all scans associated
        with it
        are put into the final experiment (assuming they have sufficient
        stations to form a baseline).</li>
      <li>Click on the boxes to add or eliminate a station from the
        observations of a given source.&nbsp; Scans will be added or
        eliminated
        from the final experiment based on whether changes give them
        enough
        stations to form a baseline.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Sources section is something of a work in progress, and
      not something anyone uses at the USNO, so it is a little confused
      at
      this point as to what it wants to be.&nbsp; It was developed
      originally
      with the idea that astronomical observers would be interested in
      sources (in geodesy they are uninteresting).&nbsp; Suggestions are
      welcome.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting Specific Scans With the "Scan
      Selection" Editor<br>
    </h5>
    <p>At any time in the scan/station selection process, the "Scan
      Selection" editor will show which scans will be included in the
      final
      experiment (included scans are green, scans not included are
      gray).&nbsp; It allows the user to make selections on a
      scan-by-scan
      basis by clicking on individual scans, or by turning all scans on
      or
      off using the "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons.<br>
      <b>IMAGE OF SCAN SELECTION PANEL WITH LABELS HERE<br>
      </b>The Scan Selection Editor includes a "Time Limits" plot that
      shows
      all scans from the original .vex file as a time sequence (again,
      scans
      in green are included, those in gray are not included).&nbsp; The
      mouse
      wheel can be used to "zoom in" on different time limits, and the
      red
      and blue triangles can be grabbed and dragged to limit the final
      experiment in time.&nbsp; This widget is somewhat redundant with
      the
      Scan/Station Timeline Editor, but it may be useful to someone.<br>

    </i><br>
    If you wish to monitor running jobs through the GUI's real-time
    plotting capabilities, the DiFX application <i>monitor_server</i>
    needs to be running.&nbsp; This program provides a TCP server at
    which
    real-time data from running DiFX processes can be obtained.&nbsp;
    The
    absence of this process is not usually a problem - if you request
    the
    real-time plotting it should be started automatically.&nbsp; However
    if
    you find that real-time plotting isn't working, this could be a
    cause.&nbsp; For details, see the<a
      href="realtime_monitor_content.html">
      Real-Time Monitor Documentation</a>.&nbsp; Note that at this time
    real-time monitoring is best considered "experimental".<br>

    <h3><a name="Running_DiFX_Remotely"></a>Running DiFX Remotely</h3>
    The GUI/guiServer communications link, which handles all interaction
    between the GUI and DiFX, is based on insecure TCP socket
    connections.&nbsp; This works fine if you run the GUI on the same
    LAN
    as the software correlator, but breaks down if you move outside
    firewalls.&nbsp; To get around such restrictions, an "ssh tunnel"
    can
    be set up through a firewall as long as you can ssh to the
    firewall.&nbsp; Running a DiFX cluster that is located behind a
    firewall using a GUI running on a machine outside the firewall can
    be
    accomplished using the following steps (the order of which is
    unimportant):<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Start <span style="font-style:
        italic;">guiServer</span>
      normally on the head node of the DiFX cluster.&nbsp; The TCP
      connection
      port will be referred to as the "connection port" in the following
      steps.</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Start an ssh tunnel from the
      location where you wish to run the GUI through the firewall.&nbsp;
      This
      is done using an ssh command with some options: <br>
    </div>
    <pre>		ssh -N -L [LOCALPORT]:[WHAT FIREWALL CALLS DIFX HEADNODE]:[CONNECTION PORT] USER@FIREWALL<br></pre>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <ul>
        <li>USER@FIREWALL is how you would log into the firewall from
          your
          local machine</li>
        <li>CONNECTION PORT is the TCP connection port used by <span
            style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> on the head
          node</li>
        <li>WHAT FIREWALL CALLS DIFX HEADNODE is the node name of the
          head
          node as the firewall sees it (what you would use if logging
          into the
          head node from the firewall)</li>
        <li>LOCALPORT is a port on the machine where the GUI is being
          run.</li>
      </ul>
      3.&nbsp; Start the GUI on the machine outside the firewall.&nbsp;
      In
      the "DiFX Control Connection" section of the "Settings" window,
      set
      "DiFX Host" to "localhost" and "Control Port" to the value of
      LOCALPORT
      you used in the ssh tunnel.&nbsp; The "guiServer Connection" light
      should turn green and you should start seeing data from the nodes
      in
      the DiFX cluser.<br>
      4.&nbsp; Click on "Channel All Data" in the "DiFX Control
      Connection"
      section of the "Settings" window.<br>
    </div>
    <h5>What is "Channel All Data" Doing?<br>
    </h5>
    The GUI/guiServer does not use a single socket for
    communication.&nbsp;
    Many activities, including creating/running jobs, examining
    directory
    structures on the correlator, and even tab completion for many GUI
    text
    fields, require opening new sockets.&nbsp; The port numbers for
    these
    sockets are all within a specific range, which you can control (see
    BLAH), so in theory you could set up tunnels for all of them.&nbsp;
    Instead, the GUI allows you to "channel" all of these exchanges
    through
    to single, tunnelled primary connection.&nbsp; To do this, turn on
    the
    "Channel All Data" setting in the "DiFX Control Connection" of the
    Settings window.&nbsp; The GUI and <span style="font-style:
      italic;">guiServer</span>
    handle the organization of packets on either side of the connection
    so
    the change should be seamless, and all activities that normally
    require
    independent sockets should act normally.&nbsp; This arrangement has
    reassuringly little impact on the performance of the single
    connection
    socket.<br>
    <h5><a name="Order_Is_Maybe_Important"></a>Order Is (Maybe)

    Experience has shown that it is best to start <i>guiServer</i> and
    any ssh tunnel or tunnels before trying to connect with the
    GUI.&nbsp; <br>

      Permissions and RSA Problems on the DiFX Host</h5>
    <p>When <i>guiServer</i> runs multi-core processes, it needs to be
      able to execute things remotely on the other nodes in the DiFX
      cluster.&nbsp; If remote keys are not set up correctly, remote
      hosts
      will prompt for permission keys.&nbsp; <i>GuiServer</i> has no
      way of
      intercepting these requests, so the runs will fail.&nbsp; You need
      to
      make sure all of your keys are in place beforehand.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To do so, log into your head node - where you are running <i>guiServer</i>
      - using the same user name (I'm calling this user name the "DiFX
      user"
      below) and <i>network route</i> that you are using to run <i>guiServer</i>
      itself.&nbsp; The latter is quite important - if you are running <i>guiServer</i>
      by logging into the head node remotely, log in again that
      way.&nbsp; If
      you are running <i>guiServer </i>from the head node console, log
      in
      that way.</p>
    <p>Next, try using <i>ssh</i> to remotely log into all of the nodes
      on
      your cluster.&nbsp; If you can do so without any key or password
      requests, you should be set.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Okay, let's say you can't.&nbsp; What do you do about it?.&nbsp;
      The
      following may work (or you may wish to bother a system
      administrator or
      somebody who knows what they are doing). &nbsp; Make sure you have
      an
      RSA key (in the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span>
      in DiFX user's home directory).&nbsp; If you don't, create one
      with the
      following command (answer any questions by hitting "return"):<br>
    </p>
    <pre>	ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
    You will have to log out and log back in for the new key to be
    active,
    or type:<br>
    <pre>	ssh-add</pre>
    Then type this for <span style="font-weight: bold;">every node</span>
    you are using, including the head node itself.&nbsp; You should use
    complete addresses for machine names, not aliases (it is not
    entirely
    clear that this is a problem, but we had some issues with it):<br>
    <pre>	ssh-copy-id user@node<br></pre>
    For instance, if your DiFX user is "difx", your head node is "king"
    and
    your other processing nodes and mark 5's are "pawn1", "pawn2",
    "mark5-1" and "mark5-2" you would need to do the following (as the
    DiFX
    user on "king"):<br>
    <pre>	ssh-copy-id difx@king<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@pawn1<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@pawn2<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@mark5-1<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@mark5-2<br></pre>
    To test whether this has worked, you should be able to "ssh" to your
    DiFX user on all nodes from root on the DiFX head node without
    entering
    a password or key.&nbsp; If you can't do this, things are not set up
    right and jobs will not run.&nbsp; Seek professional help.<br>
    <br>
    These changes should survive reboots, as well as RSA key stuff ever
    does.
