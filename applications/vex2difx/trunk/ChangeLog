Version 2.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Users can now supply comments in one or more COMMENT { } blocks
* In the ANTENNA { } blocks, one can specify  machine =  to force a datastream
  process to be run on a particular machine for a particular antenna.
  * NOTE: the global "machines" parameter must be set, from which missing
    antenna machine assignments and the usual head / core processor
    assignments will be drawn.
* outPath global parameter added: all .difx/ output gets put here rather than ./
* Split vex2difx.cpp into smaller pieces (in progress)
* If baseband data files are provided via file lists and some jobs have
  missing data, exlude antennas as necessary and write a "nodata" file
* Allow phase cal interval of 200 MHz (KVN) without warning since extraction works
* Fix guardNS calculation (finally!)...
  - Needed to consider bits per sample and number of baseband channels
  - Swiftly moving sources and/or antennas could still trigger this problem
* leap second file now optional for spice kernel evaluation.
  - If not provided, the EOPs from within the DifxInput structure will be used
* Major restructuring of code to facilitate multiple datastream support
  - vex2 support is being anticipated
  - Break out each vex table structure into its own .h/.cpp file pair
  - Vex tables remain const except through access from VexData structure
  - Load vex file without reference to the CorrParams structure (.v2d file)
  - Data (files, modules, network info) are tied to a VexAntenna structure
  - Multiple data streams (VexStream objects) are referenced from setups
* Don't export the vex library anymore.  It causes some trouble
* Some other configure.ac / Makefile.am cleanups
* If EXPER section is missing or incomplete, let user know and if forced, make assumptions.
* If vex file does not specify a record channel ordering (e.g., through TRACKS), an ordering is determined via sorting channels by their names
* Improve uniformity of classification of messages to users.  This is how they should be chosen:
  - Note : Indication that some (usually safe) assumptions are being made because of incomplete information.
  - Warning : Indication that something doesn't seem right.  Will proceed if forced.
  - Error : A problem with input data that cannot be ignored.
  - Developer error : A case where the program detected internal self inconsistency.  This implies a bug in the code.
* Support mark6 media
* Allow guardNS = 0 (default) --> mpifxcorr choses the smallest reasonable value
* Allow strideLength = 0 (default) --> mpifxcorr chooses a pretty good value for you (per datastream)
* Allow xmacLength = 0 (default) -> mpifxcorr chooses a pretty good value for you
* Don't allow changing from or to VDIF format with the .v2d file since channel order is defined differently for these two types.
* Stations defaulting to use of Canonical VDIF threads changed to VLBA antennas, VLA, and GBT only (Arecibo and Effelsberg removed).  Can be changed through environment variable CANONICAL_VDIF_USERS
* Move dataSource into VexStream object.  Not as simple as it seemed...
  - Allow "source=none" to be set for up to n-1 streams of an antenna
  - If all datastreams of an antenna have no data, better to exclude through the global antennas list.
* Make use of recorder number in TAPELOG_OBS to automatically generate multiple datastreams for simple cases.
* Move vlog from calcif2; this script is nearly obsolete but still might have some value beyond the time that calcif2 lasts.
* LBA modes: S2_data_source = VLBA -> LBAVSOP mode
* new global parameter delayModel -> .calc file DELAY MODEL parameter
* Move to use of dirlist library for parsing file listings.  This allows both old-style and new-style file lists to be used.
* It is now deprecated (but still legal) to supply file lists without start/stop times associated with each file. This capability may vanish at some point.
* Fix long standing issue w.r.t. (Mark5) media change detection: media change would never split a job.
* Option sortAntennas in .v2d file (default=true) now allows prevention of sorting (set sortAntennas=false).  Use of this feature requires an antenna list to be provided in the .v2d file.
* Remove dangerous option for antenna partial matching in .v2d file
* Version for DiFX-2.5, May 16, 2017

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Populate difxLabel in difxio->.calc and in .joblist
* Generate systematic threadId
* Verify all or none of the ephemeris parameters are provided

* Don't allow subintNS greater than about 1 second (to ward off MODE errors)
* Remove "using namespace std" from .h files; goal is to remove them from .cpp files in time
* Track oversample value in channel structure; move checking downstream to more relevant code.
* Add a few features (ephemDeltaT, ephemStellarAber, ephemClockError) useful in
  exploring spacecraft ephemeris but probably not useful for operations
* change zoom band definition to always be USB (specify lower edge freq)
* Reorder Mark5B tracks to accomodate bitstream masks
* Consider two sources within 1 mas of each other to be the same

Version 2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Allowed zoom bands to be used with profile mode also
* Version for DiFX-2.1, May 14, 2012

Version 2.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Bug fix: when sorting events, round to nearest 0.1 second
* Bug fix: order of operations in computing zoom channels: don't overflow integers
* Change parameters to be better optimized for larger bandwidths (at marginal, if any, impact to small bandwidths)
* Reimplement tweak integration time
* Fix zoom bands when statting with different bandwidths.  WFB gets a beer for this one!
* Start implementation of "global zoom bands" which can either be referenced from an ANTENNA or a SETUP
* Distinction between recorded and non-recorded channels is now more clear.  Only recorded channels will be correlated.
* No more VexFormat class.  Its contents were moved into VexSetup.
* vex2script: better job allocating RDBE personality and choosing whether or not to record

* Can set up "fake" correlations

Version 2.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* add -v option to vexpeek
* move most strcpy to snprintf and make use of parameterized string lengths in difxio
* add recordEnable map to VexScan.
* fix back-to-back scan handling when singleScan = False
* fix media changes that occur immediately before a scan change
* don't error-out if an ANTENNA block does not correspond to an entry in antennas list
* Follow refs to CLOCK entries; fall back on unreffed clocks only if no other clocks found first
* Follow refs to TAPELOG_OBS entries; fall back on unreffed VSNs only if no other VSNs found first
* Support proper vex epoch for SITE; allow mjd to continue to work
* Generalize vexDate just a bit to allow for the posibility of vexdate without all date fields
* Add sampling parameter to ANTENNA confuration
* When cross-pol enabled, allow correlation of R-L even if one antenna doesn't have both polarizations
* Try different subintNS until the readsize becomes reasonable (probably some tuning to be done still)
* Propagate .vex file phase cal extraction into .input file* Pass tcalFreq from .v2d to .input
* Support several different modes of pulse cal tone selection
* Allow different numbers of bits on different antennas within same Mode (Thanks Jasper Horrell for the bug report)
* Catch a few vex problems before segfaulting (thanks Chris Phillips for the bug report)
* Fix bug estimating the output size of the correlation
* Change the nChan input parameter to mean the number of post-averaged channels
  - Clarified in several places in the code whether nChan is nInputChan or nOutputChan
* FIXMEs are now #warnings
* Default pulse cal tone extraction mode is smart: that is take the two most extreme tones per band that are not within the outer 1/8 of the band if possible.
* Allow source names with underscores
* Fix bug calculating spectral averaging for zoom bands
* Ephemeris driven objects: use linear interpolation with a default interval of 15 seconds.  Results are much smoother.
