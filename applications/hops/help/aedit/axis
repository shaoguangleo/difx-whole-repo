COMMAND NAME:   axis

TYPE:           Plot control

SYNTAX:         "axis y-axis <x-axis>"

DESCRIPTION:

This command specifies what the X and Y axes of the next "plot" command
will be.  The y-axis specifier is mandatory, the x-axis one optional.  If
the x-axis specifier is omitted, it is assumed to be "time".  After
the "axis" command, the "plot" command with no arguments causes the specified
axes to be plotted on the current output device (see "help device").  If
the "plot" command is issued with arguments, those arguments override the
axis settings made by the "axis" command, and reset the plot inputs.  The
arguments to the "plot" command are identical to those described below.
Axis specifiers are case-insensitive.

Valid axis specifiers, with notes, are listed below:
