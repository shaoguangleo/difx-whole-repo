COMMAND NAME:	zoom

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"zoom" (no arguments)

DESCRIPTION:

Enables the cursor on an active plot on an interactive
graphics device.  The user selects a point by positioning
the cursor and typing any character except 'x' or 'X', and 
the program displays detailed information about that point 
on the terminal.  The only information displayed 
is that resident in memory (i.e. A-file information). If you
want more detail, make sure the binary data files are on
disk, set the DATADIR variable appropriately, and use the
"fplot" command to pop up a fringe plot on your Xwindow
screen.

"Zoom" is terminated by typing an 'x' or 'X'.
