Goal: all data from which difx schedules are derived come from VexTables

Exceptions: zoom bands, machines


Don't forget to:

* revisit clocks (especially poly model)

* vex_stream structure

* copy VSNs, files -> Vex struct

* dataSampling, network params to VexStream

* VexData no longer prints events.  Do this elsewhere.
