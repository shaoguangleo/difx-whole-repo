COMMAND NAME:	clear

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"clear data"
		"clear close"
		"clear inputs"
		"clear plot"
		"clear all"

DESCRIPTION:

"Clear data" removes all the data from memory, and returns
array space to the system.  Since any active plot no longer
refers to data in memory after this operation, the plot is
rendered inactive.

"Clear close" is analogous to "clear data", but removes only
closure data.

"Clear inputs" changes all the values listed by the "inputs"
command to their default values.  Typically, this means
data selection parameters are set to pass all data, and plots
revert to self-scaling.

"Clear plot" flushes the current plot, and renders a plot on
an interactive device inactive.

"Clear all" simultaneously performs all the above operations.
