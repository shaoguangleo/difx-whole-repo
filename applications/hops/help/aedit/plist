COMMAND NAME:	plist

TYPE:		action

SYNTAX:		"plist"

DESCRIPTION:

This command summarizes the state of extracted parameters in memory.  Various
states can exist, with varying degrees of overlap between flagged and unflagged
records, with and without attached extracted parameters.  This command is
provided to remind the user of the degree to which he/she has confused
him/herself.

A more important function is to attach a numerical identifying tag to each
extracted parameter present.  This tag is then used to identify the parameter
to be examined in filtering operations, using the "prange" command, or the
parameter to plot, in the "axis" command.  You can see whether you got the 
specification correct by using the "inputs" command after attempting to use 
"prange", or by looking at the axis labels on the plot.

The id tag is the first field in the output of "plist".
