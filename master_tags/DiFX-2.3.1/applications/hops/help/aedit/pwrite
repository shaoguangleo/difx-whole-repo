COMMAND NAME:	pwrite

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"pwrite filename precision"

DESCRIPTION:

Writes all unflagged user-extracted parameter data in memory out 
to the filename specified in the argument.  The data are written out
according to the current sort order (as determined by
execution of the "sort" command).  If the data are not
sorted, the output order is the same as the order in
which the data were read.  You must execute the parameter command
before using pwrite.  Unflagged data lines which for any reason
do not have associated extracted parameters are ignored by pwrite.

The list of user-extracted parameters is preceded by information
identifying the baseline, scan and extent number, together with
a few other generally useful items (but far less than is present
in the A-file format).

The optional precision argument specifies the number of significant
digits which will be printed for the parameters, in the range 1-15.
The default is 6.  All parameters are stored as double precision
floating point numbers.
