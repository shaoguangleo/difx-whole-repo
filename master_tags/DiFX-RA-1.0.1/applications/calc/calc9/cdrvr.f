C 1.1   DRIVR PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
C
C 1.1.1 DRIVR is the main calculation subroutine. It calculates the theoretical
C       delays and delay rates, the contributions of each model module to the
C       delays and delay rates, the partials of the delays and delay rates with
C       respect to model module parameters, and the coordinate time at site #1.

C PROGRAM STRUCTURE
C
C  Perform the geometry and time calculations.
C     The basic coordinate system is referenced to the Epoch of 2000.0 and is a
C     right-handed Cartesian system oriented to the mean celestial pole and mean
C     equator of that epoch. The nominal origin is the solar system barycenter.
C     There is also an Earth fixed coordinate system which is a right-handed
C     Cartesian system oriented to the mean geographic pole of 1900-1906 and the
C     Greenwich Meridian. The nominal origin is the Earth's center of mass. The
C     basic unit of time is the coordinate second as used by the PEP Tape. UTC,
C     AT, AND UT1 are also used. The geometry of the observation is calculated
C     with an accuracy goal of 0.1 picoseconds of delay. In doing the
C     calculations for the geometry, much of the work neccesary for the
C     computation of model contributions to delay and delay rate and partials of
C     delay and delay rate with respect to model parameters is also done.
C     Matrices which represent coordinate rotations (precession, nutation,
C     diurnal spin, diurnal polar motion, and wobble) and their CT time
C     derivatives are stored as (3,3,N) arrays, where N indixes the N-1'th time
C     derivative. The subroutines suffixed G are sections of model modules. The
C     other subroutines may be considered utilities and either superseed or
C     incorporate many present PEP routines.
C
C     Call SITG for the geographical site data. SITG provides the following
C     geocentric information for each observing site: the antenna axis offsets

C     the crust fixed baseline vector (CFBASE), the crust fixed site normal unit
C     vectors (CFSITN), the geodetic latitudes (SITLAT), the site east
C     longitudes (SITLON), the spherical Earth radii, the partial derivatives of
C     the crust fixed site vector components with respect to the geodetic
C     latitudes (CFLAT) and east longitudes (CFLON), the rotation matrices which
C     rotate the topocentric site reference system to the geocentric system at
C     each site (TCTOCF), and the zenith tropospheric path delays at each
C     observing site. SITG is the only routine which 'knows' which two sites are
C     involved in the observation. All other routines merely work with site #1
C     and site #2.

C  Perform the contributions calculations.
C     The individual module contributions are calcualted so that they may be

C     to first order with sufficient accuracy using the partial derivatives of
C     the dalays and rates with respect to the model module parameters. Each
C     section will PUT its contributions into the observation item using the
C     database handler. Note that the relativity contributions are now in 
C     subroutine THERY.
