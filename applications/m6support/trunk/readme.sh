This package provides supporting utilities and testing scripts which
are not part of the core Mark6 product.  After installation, you should
have available

    vdifuse         a fuse application providing a filesystem which
                    hides the underlying details of the scatter-gather
                    filesystem

    scan_check      similar to cplane intrinsic scan check, but with
                    more detailed output available

    vdif_time       a simple time conversion utility

and several test scripts:

    hammer.sh       a script to condition a module (verify r/w performance)
    hammerplot.sh   a script to process output from hammer.sh (only if
                    you have gnuplot installed, otherwise roll your own)

Each of these scripts/programs supports --help for more detailed usage.

configure --help=short offers some configuration options.
