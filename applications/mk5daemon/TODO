mk5daemon
~~~~~~~~~
? Fix reboot->busy or condition->busy state changes
x ssopen bug?
* Add IPMI support

Reboot under RHEL7:
{
  setuid(0);
  execl("/usr/bin/systemctl", "reboot", "--force", NULL);
}

? cope better with disks that generate I/O errors during startMk5Daemon, e.g., avoid this:
   "The following error has occured: Cannot mount  device /dev/sdq1 at /mnt/disks/3/2.  Reason: Input/output error
    This might be caused by insufficient permissions. On a Mark6 machine mk5daemon must be started as root!
