 - check again why ctypes does not like C++ std::complex,
   and whether there is any workaround, if necessary

 - setup.py is using ancient distutils.core or setuptools 
   because setup.py was intended to also run on a Mark6 (Debian 
   Sid). Could consider moving to a much more modern setup 
   system. Would need testing.

 - convert Makefile into a better build system, possibly
   using ./configure --ctypes-dir=<dir> so that manual
   editing of Makefile 'CTYPESLIBHOME' is not required

 - consider whether or not the ./python/examples/ should
   be installed somewhere as well upon "make install"
