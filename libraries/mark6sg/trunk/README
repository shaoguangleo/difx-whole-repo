The library is available under a GNU GPL 3.0 license.

The library provides file-like access to recordings made in 
the Mark6 SG (scatter-gather) mode. Documentation on how
to use the library from user programs can be found under 
the doc/ directory.

An example program can be found under test/

See COMPILING for instructions to build the library.

The last step ('sudo make install') will install the library, 
header files, and a package config file. You may check if
the latter worked via
  pkg-config --cflags mark6sg
