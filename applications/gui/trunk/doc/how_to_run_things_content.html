    This document contains an end-to-end description of how the DiFX
    user interface can be used to run DiFX jobs.&nbsp; All steps in the
    process are described in roughly the sequence they would be employed
    in actually running a job.&nbsp; Because the GUI has many options
    that can cause branching paths in step-by-step instructions, what
    follows is only a description of a "sample" procedure for running a
    job.&nbsp; The specific needs of individual users, data and
    installations will likely require approaches that differ some, or
    possibly a lot.&nbsp; With this in mind, links are provided to other
    sections of the documentation that may provide additional details on
    each subject.<br>
    <br>
    This document is <i>not</i> a comprehensive tutorial on all of the
    functionality of DiFX itself.&nbsp; A good place to start looking
    for that sort of thing is <a
      href="http://cira.ivec.org/docuwiki/doku.php/difx/start">here</a>.<br>
    <h3><a name="Startup"></a>Startup and Connecting to the DiFX Host<br>
    </h3>
    Starting the GUI and setting up a connection such that it can
    control DiFX is a multi-stage process.&nbsp; Some components of DiFX
    should be running for the GUI to properly communicate with it.&nbsp;
    There is no requirement that these processes be started before the
    GUI is started, and they and the GUI are designed to recover from
    losing contact with each other - effectively you should be able to
    start and stop all of them at will.<br>
    <p><i><b>guiServer</b></i><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><b><i>mk5daemon</i></b><br>
      <br>
      The actual processing components of DiFX are started on the fly as
      they are needed, however a properly configured DiFX installation
      will have some light-impact processes that are running
      constantly.&nbsp; Specifically important for the GUI, the <i>mk5daemon</i>
      process should be running on every DiFX hardware component
      (processors, MK5 units, etc.).&nbsp; The reason for this is that
      <i>mk5daemon</i> produces the periodic "heartbeats" for each
      component, including such information as CPU and memory load and
      read/write operations.&nbsp; <i>Mk5daemon</i> is also important
      because it is the only way the GUI knows that a component exists
      and is available as a resource - without it the component will not
      be utilized in DiFX processing.<br>
      <br>
      It is possible to run DiFX using the GUI with <i>mk5daemon</i>
      absent on some or all components, but this is not a subject
      covered here.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>monitor_server</i></b><i><br>
      </i><br>
      If you wish to monitor running jobs through the GUI's real-time
      plotting capabilities, the DiFX application <i>monitor_server</i>
      needs to be running.&nbsp; This program provides a TCP server at
      which real-time data from running DiFX processes can be
      obtained.&nbsp; The absence of this process is not usually a
      problem - if you request the real-time plotting it should be
      started automatically.&nbsp; However if you find that real-time
      plotting isn't working, this could be a cause.&nbsp; For details,
      see the<a href="realtime_monitor_content.html"> Real-Time Monitor
        Documentation</a>.&nbsp; Note that at this time real-time
      monitoring is best considered "experimental".<br>

    <h3><a name="Some_Important_Settings"></a>Some Important Settings</h3>
    <p>The GUI has many options the user can set to govern processing,
      how data are stored, and where necessary components are
      located.&nbsp; Most of these needn't be touched on a job-by-job
      basis as long as the GUI is running smoothly and appears to be
      doing things correctly.&nbsp; Below is a list of some of the
      settings that are more likely to require user changes.&nbsp; A
      comprehensive list of settings and their options is contained in
      the <a href="settings_content.html">Settings Documentation</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Note that settings are preserved between GUI sessions, so once
      you have things set up and running properly you should be able to
      restart the GUI and have it run properly right away.<br>

    <h5>The Contents of the Queue Browser</h5>
    <p>The Queue Browser is described in greater detail <a
        href="mainWindow_content.html#Queue_Browser">here</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Queue Browser organizes DiFX jobs under a three-level
      hierarchy with "Experiments" at the top level.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <b>Experiment</b> is usually bound to a single data set
        (one or more scans) collected over a specific time span - the
        results of a single observing session for instance.&nbsp; It can
        contain any number of "Passes" (including zero).</li>
      <li>A <b>Pass</b> is used to contain a single analysis of a
        subset of the data.&nbsp; Often Experiments contain a "Clock
        Pass" run on a few scans to generate the time delays for each
        involved antenna, and a "Production Pass" run on all scans with
        those time delays in place.</li>
      <li>Within each Pass is a series of <b>Jobs</b>, each controlling
        the processing of at least one scan.&nbsp; DiFX is run on one
        Job at a time.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div align="center"><img alt=""

    <h5>Adding Existing Experiments to the Queue Browser</h5>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Creating_a_New_Experiment"></a>Creating a New
      Experiment</h3>
    <p>To create a new experiment all that is required is a .vex file
      and appropriate data.&nbsp; The GUI will perform (or facilitate)
      the various steps required to set up an experiment for DiFX
      processing based on instructions from the user.&nbsp; In short,
      these steps amount to:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Setting up a location to do the processing</li>
      <li>Creating a .v2d file to go with the .vex file</li>
      <li>Running <i>vex2difx</i> and <i>calcif2</i> to create .input
        and .im files</li>
    </ol>
    The GUI tries to be as flexible as possible about this, although it
    has a "preferred" way of arranging things such that running DiFX
    processing on the created experiments is possible through the GUI as
    well.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    To create a new experiment, select "Create New.." under the
    "Experiments" menu in the Queue Browser.<br>
    <b>IMAGE<br>
    </b>This will bring up the "Create New Experiment" window:<br>
    <b>IMAGE</b><br>
    The purpose of this window is to allow the user to tailor a new
    experiment to meet their needs.&nbsp; It creates a "working"
    directory for the new experiment, allows the specification of data
    sources, and puts all relevant DiFX files (<tt>.v2d</tt>, <tt>.input</tt>,
    etc.) in the working directory from which they can be run (either
    through the GUI or by hand).&nbsp; Experimentation with different
    GUI settings while creating an experiment is not dangerous as the
    original <tt>.vex</tt> file and data files are not moved or altered
    in any way.&nbsp; If you mess up, delete the experiment and try
    again.<br>
    <h4>Naming the New Experiment and Putting It Somewhere<br>
    </h4>
    <h4>Getting .vex File Content<br>
    </h4>
    <p>bleah<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Changing .vex File Content</h4>
    <p>Once you have obtained .vex data from some source, the data are
      displayed in the ".vex File Editor" panel.&nbsp; This panel
      provides a (rather rudimentary) text editor that can be used to
      edit the .vex data by hand.&nbsp; The final edited text is used in
      the .vex file assigned to your created experiment, a copy of which
      is put in your working directory.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Some care should be taken in directly editing .vex data as it is
      trivial to corrupt the .vex to the point where it can't be used
      (the DiFX operational paradigm says that users should never need
      to do this), but editing this content does not alter the original
      source .vex file, only the final .vex file associated with the
      experiment - so playing around with things is not permanently
      harmful.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Correlation Tuning Parameters</h4>
    <p>The Correlation Tuning Parameters section includes values that
      can be changed to adjust the quality of the correlation results,
      and/or the total time processing takes.&nbsp; Adjustments to many
      of these values is something of an art in itself, and the details
      of what things do and what their "best" values should be is not
      covered here (some talks at the DiFX Users Meetings have covered
      the subject - slides can be viewed here).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each item has an associated "apply" check box.&nbsp; If this box
      is not checked, no instructions regarding the item will be put in
      the <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">.v2d</font> file
      and <i>vex2difx</i> will be allowed to pick its own
      defaults.&nbsp; <i>Unless you know what you are doing, don't
        check the apply box - let </i>vex2difx<i> pick the values!</i>&nbsp;
      The GUI has default values for all items but they are not based on
      anything - they are essentially placeholders.&nbsp; The default
      values that are picked by <i>vex2difx</i> are far better.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Stations and Data Sources</h4>
    <p>Each antenna involved in the observations described by the .vex
      data triggers the creation of a panel in the "Stations"
      section.&nbsp; The two-letter code station/antenna code is used as
      a panel title (associated with each station is a check box that
      can be used to eliminate the station from the experiment - see <a
        href="#Eliminating_Stations_in_the_Stations">below</a>).&nbsp;
      Each station panel contains four sub-sections: Data Source;
      Antenna; Site; and Settings.<br>
      <b>IMAGE OF A STATION PANEL<br>
      </b>In most cases users only make changes to the Settings and Data
      Source sections.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Source</h5>
    <p>The Data Source section tells DiFX where the data for a
      particular station/antenna can be found.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Because filling out the Data Source section can be tedious, the
      DiFX GUI provides a way of pre-defining all Data Source settings
      for a station/antenna in the Settings "Job Creation Settings"
      section (see <a href="settings_content.html#ANTENNA_DEFAULTS">Antenna
        Defaults</a>).<br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Settings</h5>
    <p>The Settings section contains settings for Tone, Phase
      Calibration Interval and Delta Clock.&nbsp; The Delta Clock value
      is often gleaned by running a "Clock Pass" on a subset of the
      experiment's data (see some sort of explanation here).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Selecting Specific Scans<br>
    </h4>
    When new .vex data are selected, the GUI begins with the assumption
    that all scans described in the data will be included in the new
    experiment.&nbsp; There are a number of ways of adjusting which
    scans are ultimately used, and which stations are used in which
    scans.&nbsp; These changes are reflected in the final .v2d and .vex
    files that are created as part of the new experiment.&nbsp; The
    "Scan Selection" Editor can be used at any time to view the scans
    that will be included in the experiment when it is created.<br>
    <b>IMAGE OF SCAN SELECTION EDITOR</b><br>
    <br>
    Some of the scan and station selection controls can work at
    cross-purposes - effectively they provide more than one way to cause
    a scan or a station to be used.&nbsp; When a conflict occurs, the
    GUI will give the most recent command precedence (if, for instance,
    a command is given that a scan be included in the final experiment
    when a previous command eliminated the scan, the GUI will include
    the scan).&nbsp; <br>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminating Stations in the "Source" .vex
      Data</h5>
    <p>Stations can be eliminated from individual scans by putting a
      "-1" in the "code" column within the appropriate "scan" section in
      the "source" .vex data.&nbsp; When the GUI encounters the "-1", it
      will remove the station from the scan.&nbsp; This duplicates
      hardware correlator behavior.&nbsp; Starting with the .vex data
      example below, the final .vex file will not include the station
      BLAT because of the "-1" in the final column.<br>
    </p>
    <pre>gslkadfglkdgflksdgflkjsdfgklsjdfkgl<br>fdsgl;jsdfgljkdsfgklsdfkjlkjfgsdkjdfsgkjldf<br>dfs;lgjsdgfjksdjkfjksdfjkdsfgjkdfsgj<br></pre>
    If you do not want the GUI to pay attention to the "-1" code in this
    way, un-check the <a
      href="settings_content.html#Eliminate_Stations_With_Code">Eliminate
      Stations With "-1" Code</a> box in the Settings menu.<br>
    <h5><a name="Eliminating_Stations_in_the_Stations"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Eliminating Stations in the "Stations" Section<br>
    </h5>
    <p>The "Stations" section is primarily set up to change parameters
      related to each antenna involved in an experiment, and to select
      the data sources associated with them (see above).&nbsp; However
      it also includes a check box that can be used to completely remove
      each station from the experiment. Any scans that no longer have
      enough stations to form a baseline (i.e. less than two) will be
      eliminated.&nbsp; <br>
      <b>IMAGE</b><br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Scan/Station Timeline" Editor</h5>
    <p>The "Scan/Station Timeline" section provides a visual map of all
      scans and the stations used in them in a timeline.&nbsp; It allows
      the selection/deselection of individual stations within scans or
      the inclusion of data from different stations based on time.<br>
      <b>IMAGE<br>
      </b>Somewhat more complex explanation here.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting by Source Using the "Sources"
      Editor<br>
    </h5>
    <p>The "Sources" section shows all sources and the stations used to
      observe them.&nbsp; It allows sources to be selected and
      deselected, and stations to be selectively used or eliminated from
      sources.<br>
      <b>IMAGE<br>
      </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>All sources included in the .vex file are listed.&nbsp; Boxes
        show which sources are observed with which stations.</li>
      <li>Hover over the name of a source to produce a tooltip that
        includes information about the source as well as the names of
        the scans used to observe it and the stations used for each of
        those scans (stations marked in red have been eliminated).</li>
      <li>Hover over the boxes to produce a tooltip that includes which
        scans use the associated station on the associated source.&nbsp;
        A scan that appears in red text has been eliminated - either
        explicitly or because it lacks sufficient stations to form a
        baseline.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Use check boxes to add or eliminate a source.&nbsp; When a
        source is removed, all scans associated with it are eliminated
        from the final experiment.&nbsp; When a source is added, all
        scans associated with it are put into the final experiment
        (assuming they have sufficient stations to form a baseline).</li>
      <li>Click on the boxes to add or eliminate a station from the
        observations of a given source.&nbsp; Scans will be added or
        eliminated from the final experiment based on whether changes
        give them enough stations to form a baseline.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b></b>The Sources section is something of a work in progress,
      and not something anyone uses at the USNO, so it is a little
      confused at this point as to what it wants to be.&nbsp; It was
      developed originally with the idea that astronomical observers
      would be interested in sources (in geodesy they are
      uninteresting).&nbsp; Suggestions are welcome.</p>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting Specific Scans With the "Scan
      Selection" Editor<br>
    </h5>
    <p>At any time in the scan/station selection process, the "Scan
      Selection" editor will show which scans will be included in the
      final experiment (included scans are green, scans not included are
      gray).&nbsp; It allows the user to make selections on a
      scan-by-scan basis by clicking on individual scans, or by turning
      all scans on or off using the "Select All" and "Clear All"
      buttons.<br>
      <b>IMAGE OF SCAN SELECTION PANEL WITH LABELS HERE<br>
      </b>The Scan Selection Editor includes a "Time Limits" plot that
      shows all scans from the original .vex file as a time sequence
      (again, scans in green are included, those in gray are not
      included).&nbsp; The mouse wheel can be used to "zoom in" on
      different time limits, and the red and blue triangles can be
      grabbed and dragged to limit the final experiment in time.&nbsp;
      This widget is somewhat redundant with the Scan/Station Timeline
      Editor, but it may be useful to someone.<br>

      Permissions and RSA Problems on the DiFX Host</h5>
    <p>When <i>guiServer</i> runs multi-core processes, it needs to be
      able to execute things remotely on the other nodes in the DiFX
      cluster.&nbsp; If remote keys are not set up correctly, remote
      hosts will prompt for permission keys.&nbsp; <i>GuiServer</i> has
      no way of intercepting these requests, so the runs will
      fail.&nbsp; You need to make sure all of your keys are in place
      beforehand.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To do so, log into your head node - where you are running <i>guiServer</i>
      - using the same user name (I'm calling this user name the "DiFX
      user" below) and <i>network route</i> that you are using to run <i>guiServer</i>
      itself.&nbsp; The latter is quite important - if you are running <i>guiServer</i>
      by logging into the head node remotely, log in again that
      way.&nbsp; If you are running <i>guiServer </i>from the head
      node console, log in that way.</p>
    <p>Next, try using <i>ssh</i> to remotely log into all of the nodes
      on your cluster.&nbsp; If you can do so without any key or
      password requests, you should be set.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Okay, let's say you can't.&nbsp; What do you do about it?.&nbsp;
      The following may work (or you may wish to bother a system
      administrator or somebody who knows what they are doing). &nbsp;
      Make sure you have an RSA key (in the file <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span> in DiFX
      user's home directory).&nbsp; If you don't, create one with the
      following command (answer any questions by hitting "return"):<br>
    </p>
    <pre>	ssh-keygen -t rsa</pre>
    You will have to log out and log back in for the new key to be
    active, or type:<br>
    <pre>	ssh-add</pre>
    Then type this for <span style="font-weight: bold;">every node</span>
    you are using, including the head node itself.&nbsp; You should use
    complete addresses for machine names, not aliases (it is not
    entirely clear that this is a problem, but we had some issues with
    it):<br>
    <pre>	ssh-copy-id user@node<br></pre>
    For instance, if your DiFX user is "difx", your head node is "king"
    and your other processing nodes and mark 5's are "pawn1", "pawn2",
    "mark5-1" and "mark5-2" you would need to do the following (as the
    DiFX user on "king"):<br>
    <pre>	ssh-copy-id difx@king<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@pawn1<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@pawn2<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@mark5-1<br>	ssh-copy-id difx@mark5-2<br></pre>
    To test whether this has worked, you should be able to "ssh" to your
    DiFX user on all nodes from root on the DiFX head node without
    entering a password or key.&nbsp; If you can't do this, things are
    not set up right and jobs will not run.&nbsp; Seek professional
    help.<br>
    <br>
    These changes should survive reboots, as well as RSA key stuff ever
    does.
