      LINUX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STREAMSTOR SDK Version 8.x

This is a BETA version of SDK Version 8.1.  It includes the following
API and firmware:

	API Version: 7.06
	API Datecode: Jan 25 2008
	XF2/VXF2 Firmware Version: 12.03
	XF2/VXF2 Firmware Datecode: Jan 14 2008
	Amazon Firmware Version:  14.03
	Amazon Firmware Datecode: Jan 10 2008
	WinDriver 9.10

NOTE: The installation must be performed as "root" since hardware device
drivers must be installed.  

Programs linked with a StreamStor SDK API (libssapi.a) from SDK releases 
prior to SDK 8.x are not compatible with SDK 8.x.  To use SDK 8.x, you must 
recompile your programs with the new API.  You must also execute flash_upgrade 
so that the new SDK 8.x firmware gets flashed on your StreamStor (see below). 

1. Create a directory to hold the StreamStor files and sub-directories, for
   example, /usr/local/streamstor.

2. Change directory to the installation directory (cd /usr/local/streamstor).

3. Extract the StreamStor files:
     tar xvzf /mnt/cdrom/linux/XXX.tgz (or other path if not CDROM)
   where XXX is the name of the filename of the .tgz file (e.g., sslinux80.tgz).

4. The driver, windrvr6.o, is a kernel module. It must be recompiled for
   every kernel version on which it is loaded.  IMPORTANT:  In order to 
   recompile windrvr6, you must have the Linux kernel source installed 
   on your system.

   After you have ensured that the kernel source is installed, recompile 
   windrvr6.o, cd to the driver/redist directory then enter:
                ./configure
                chmod 755 setup_inst_dir
                chmod 755 wdreg
                make install

   The shared library, libwdapi801.so will be installed /usr/lib.  
   Your application code must link to this library.

   Note that the "configure" program will generate the driver makefile.
   You must run "configure" to create a new makefile and then rebuild the 
   driver whenever you upgrade your Linux operating system.

5. Follow instructions that are output by the install script to load the 
   driver module on startup and to set permissions on /dev/windrvr6. 
   Note that instructions for installing the WinDriver kernel module
   may change from release to release, so please be sure to read them.

6. Set the environment variable "STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH" to the location of
   the StreamStor local bib directory.  For example, if you have 
   installed the StreamStor files in /usr/local/streamstor:

            STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH=/usr/local/streamstor/bib
            export STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH

7. Run linux/util/sstest to verify operation of StreamStor.

8. The directory linux/example contains the source code for several 
   examples.  Examine the example.mk file in that directory and change the 
   STREAMSTOR path variable (if necessary) to point to the path where you 
   have installed the StreamStor API.  Then, "make" the example and run 
   it to verify that the StreamStor library and headers have been 
   installed correctly. 

IMPORTANT:  As described in the readme.html file for this SDK, beginning with 
SDK Release 7.1, firmware and/or monitor code may need to be flashed (rather 
than downloaded) onto boards. The new utility program, flash_upgrade can be 
executed to flash the boards.  flash_upgrade will examine the current monitor 
version on all installed StreamStor boards on a system and then perform any
necessary upgrades. If no upgrade is needed (e.g., your StreamStor boards do 
not support the flash_upgrade utility or your boards are already flashed 
appropriately), flash_upgrade will report that no upgrade is required.

Anytime you install a new SDK, you should evaluate whether or not you want 
to upgrade the firmware or monitor code on your StreamStor boards with the 
versions provided in the new SDK.  If you want to upgrade, then you must run 
flash_upgrade.

If you run flash_upgrade on your StreamStor boards, you cannot return to 
older versions of flashed code unless you return your board to Conduant for 
re-flashing. Therefore, please make sure that you want to permanently 
upgrade your StreamStor boards prior to executing flash_upgrade.
