  == Mark6 Scatter-Gather File Abstraction : mark6sg v1.0.0 ==


The library is available under a GNU GPL 3.0 license.

The library provides file-like access to recordings made in 
the Mark6 SG (scatter-gather) mode. Documentation on how
to use the library from user programs can be found under 
the doc/ directory.

An example program can be found under test/

See COMPILING for instructions to build the library.

The last step ('sudo make install') will install the library, 
header files, and a package config file. You may check if
the latter worked via
  pkg-config --cflags mark6sg

The library includes some command line utilities:

$ m6sg_mount [-u]

 Mounts or unmounts (-u) all Mark6 disks.
 No need to start dplane, cplane and da-client.

$ m6sg_gather [--list | <scanname> <destination>]
 
 A counterpart of the Mark6 'gather' utility but using
 the mark6sg library.

 Combines all scattered files associated with a single scan,
 specified by <scanname>, and writes the gathered data into
 the specifified <destination> file or directory.

 When invoked with --list, all scans on the Mark6 disks are listed. 
 These scan names can be used as the <scanname> argument later.
