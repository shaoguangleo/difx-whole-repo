#### INSTALLATION ##############
To install DiFX-2.3, first go to the area you wish the source code to reside
and checkout the code with

  svn co https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/master_tags/DiFX-2.3.
  cd DiFX-2.3

You probably already did that, if you're reading this README, so in
the DiFX-2.3 directory, do this:

1) Ensure you have a working installation of IPP and MPI
2) Open setup.bash or setup.csh in your favourite text editor and change the
DIFXROOT, IPPROOT, MPICXX and PGPLOT paths and the perl versions to suit your system
3) source setup.bash (or .csh). You will probably want to add this to your 
.bashrc or .cshrc file
4) Run "./install-difx"

Thats it. DiFX should compile - if not, check out the troubleshooting
area on http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/start

There are optional applications that can be installed using install-difx:
difxfilterbank (--withfb) and HOPS (--withhops).  Both of these require
PGPLOT, which can be finicky, which is why they are not included
by default.  You may need to tweak your PGPLOT setup to get them to work.

There is one other application, difx_monitor, which also has an
install-difx switch (--with-monitor) but which does not compile since
it has not yet been set up with an autotools Make system.  It also 
uses PGPLOT (but does not use the environment variables already set up).
To compile this package, cd to applications/difx_monitor/, edit Makefile
and then run make, make install.

#### FURTHER DOCUMENTATION ######

The DiFX users guide is your friend.  You can find this at the top level
of the DiFX source tree, under doc/userguide/.  Go there and type make, 
and you will get a pdf full of interesting and useful information, mostly
written and maintained by Walter Brisken.
