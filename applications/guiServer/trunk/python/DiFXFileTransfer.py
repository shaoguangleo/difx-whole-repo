## Class used to send and receive files to/from the DiFX Server
#
#  This class can be used to perform data transfers to and from files on the
#  DiFX server.  There are basically two things you can do - send data to files,
#  and grab data from files.  In both cases you need to provide full path
#  names.  A sample use of the class:
#
#  \code{.py}
#  #  Open a new instance of the file transfer class
#  difx = DiFXFileTransfer.Client()
#  difx.connect()
#  difx.monitor()
#
#  #  Create some data
#  theData = "this is some data"
#
#  #  Put it in a new file location on the server.  Always use the
#  #  full path!
#  difx.sendFile( "/tmp/newFile", theData )
#
#  #  Get the content of a file (in this case the same file)
#  junk = difx.getFile( "/tmp/newFile" )
#  print junk
#  \endcode
#
#  More complete code examples of the above procedures can be found in the
#  \ref difxgetfile "DiFXgetFile" and \ref difxsendfile "DiFXsendFile" example
#  applications.

	## Construct an XML file transfer command and send it.
	#
	#  This is an internally-used method that builds the XML command out of
	#  the components necessary for a file transfer.  Many of these components
	#  are not used and are part of the XML for historical reasons.  All you
	#  really need are:
	#     <ul>
	#     <li><b>origin</b> - A full path of a file on the server (for "get" operations only)
	#     <li><b>destination</b> - A full path at which to write a file on the server (for "send" operations)
	#     <li><b>direction</b> - Either "from DiFX" or "to DiFX" for send or get operations respectively
	#     <li><b>port</b> - A "channel" number to route the return data.
	#     </ul>
