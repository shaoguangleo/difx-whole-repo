*  skip_data is a function that determines whether or not a particular scan, as*
*  specified by the baseline, source, group, and start time, is to be fourfit'd*
*  This is accomplished by searching through the chained list of control       *
*  blocks, looking for any specification that this scan should be skipped.     *
*                                                                              *
*  Inputs:     scantime       Start of scan as integer secs since 1980.0       *
*              baseline       String containing the 2 char baseline.           *
*              source         String containing the 1--32 char source name.    *
*              group          Single character containing freq. group          *
*                                                                              *
*  Outputs:    <none>                                                          *

*  Returns:    0 = FALSE: fourfit this scan                                    *
*              1 = TRUE:  skip this scan                                       *
