---------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   fourmer

SYNOPSIS:  a program to join two scans into one

SYNTAX:  fourmer root-A root-B [msglev]

OPTION FLAGS:	none

ARGUMENTS:	root-A
			path to the root of one scan
		root-B
			path to the root of the second scan
		msglev
			an integer -3 .. 3, inclusive, which controls the
			amount of commentary (less is more; default is 2).

ENVIRONMENT:	HOPS_FOURMER_FG, HOPS_FOURMER_JOIN, HOPS_FOURMER_EXPN,
                HOPS_FOURMER_ROOT_ONLY

DESCRIPTION:

Fourmer makes a best-effort attempt to join two scans into a single
scan.  This only makes sense if the data was captured at the same time
and if the channels are disjoint.  The channel names are renamed with
'A' or 'B' inserted following the frequency group identifier.

In theory the resulting scan data should be used by fourfit, but this
has not been extensively tested.  The results of fourmer may be again
combined by fourmer; however, note that various internal size limits
may be thereby exceeded if you do this more than once.

Environment variables are presently available for minor tweaks.  The
variable HOPS_FOURMER_FG may be used to override the frequency group
identifier with a new value.  The new scan name is based on the common
start from the two scans with 'JOIN' appended; HOPS_FOURMER_JOIN allows
you to specify something other than the default string 'JOIN'.  You can
use a null string (HOPS_FOURMER_JOIN='') if you like.  HOPS_FOURMER_EXPN
will attempt to override the experiment number with a new value. Finally,
HOPS_FOURMER_ROOT_ONLY is for debugging, and merely generates a new root
file but no Type-1 or Type-3 files.

The result of the join is placed in the current working directory, so if
you are joining a hierarchy, you'll need to make your own arrangements.
