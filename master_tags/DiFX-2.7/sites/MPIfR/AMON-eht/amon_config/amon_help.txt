                                     WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?

AMON (Alist MONitor) is a GUI tool to facilitate analysis of large VLBI experiments. It visualizes
information from .vex and .alist files and acts as a launching platform for fourfit plots.

                                      RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

python amon.py <.alist file name>  <.vex file name>

python amon.py <.vex file name> (will display only inactive elements based on .vex)  

python amon.py (displays only this part of the help)   

Python 2.7 or later is assumed, this version WON'T run with Python 3. 
Standard Python libraries required for this script are: sys, os, shutil, subprocess, 
                                                        numpy, matplotlib, Tkinter.
They are typically included in most Python distributions.

Many important features of this program will work only if hops fplot and gs are available. 

To run, this version of AMON must include the following files (all files except amon.py
are placed in two subdirectories, amon_lib and amon_config):

amon.py                                                                  main script

                                    CONFIG FILE DESCRIPTION

General rules: * All lines of this file should be set correctly before launching the GUI for
                 everything to work properly.
               * Most lines need to be set only once for a particular setup, but at least one
                 (the path to the fourfit results) need to be changed for every new experiment. 
               * Symbol # is used for commenting, everything following it in any line is ignored.
               * If the line is empty, contains only spaces or the first meaningful symbol in it
                 (after a number of spaces) is #, it is read as an empty string.
               * The meaningful value(s) may be preceded or separated by any number of spaces,
                 the spaces are ignored.

lines 01-02:                can contain anything, reserved for the header

lines 03-14:  deal with the specific .alist file configuration, the numbers listed here correspond
              to one particular version (v.3?) of alist. You need to set them only once for
              a specific .alist version you are using. If you are unsure, just open one of your
              .alist files and count which column is for what characterictic.
              NOTE: THE COLUMN NUMBERING STARTS WITH 0

              information from the next three columns is needed to reconstruct
              fplot file names, which typically look like XP.W.19.zymnxc

                        resolution of your monitor, but large enough to fit all the GUI controls.
                        At this moment there is no fool-proofing of these parameters, so if you
                        give negative or zero values, you just crush the script.

line 16:      0.1 # (single float) SBD (single-band delay) threshold for "bad" values in usec.
                    This is important only for the SBD view mode, in which the color of each
                    element is based on how far the residual SBD of this element is from zero.
                    When the absolute value of SBD exceeds this threshold, value of 0 is assigned
                    to the element, corresponding to bright red ("bad"). When the value is below
                    the threshold, it is mapped to the scale of 1-9 (corresponding colors: dark red
                    ("worse") - brown ("better") - green ("good") - bright green ("the best").
 
line 17:      0.3 # (single float) DRATE (delay rate) threshold for "bad" values in ps/sec.

                  the actual files and entries in lines 18-19 must correspond to each other. Curren
                  setup assumes that the files are in the amon_config subdir of the launch dir, but
                  you can also provide an absolute or relative path to the files,
                  e. g. /amon/amon_files/amon_help.txt

line 20: 100 50 # (two ints) horizontal and vertical help window size
                  Note: this is TEXT size (in font-12 symbols, not pixels!). Since the width
                  depends on formatting of this text file, it is not recommended to change the
                  horizontal size (unless you like to reformat this whole text). But feel free to
                  change the vertical size to anything that suits you.
                  At this moment there is no fool-proofing of these parameters, so if you
                  give negative or zero values, you just crush the script.

line 21: /Exps/c172c/v1/1234/  # (string) path to the dir with the fourfit output
                               THE MOST IMPORTANT parameter to set and the easiest to forget.
                               If you want to use the fplot viewing feature you MUST provide here
                               the absolute or the relative path to the directory with all the
                               fplot files (i. e. with scan-name dirs like No0001, No0002 etc.
                               each containing file names like XP.W.19.zymnxc).

                                        This needs to be set only once for your particular hops
                                        installation. The fplot viewing feature won't work unless
                                        you point it to the right directory, containing fplot
                                        script.

line 23: Eb t #(any number of strings separated by spaces) Excluded ants in one- or two-letter code
              This line may be empty or contain any number of strings. If one or more of them
              corresponds to a one- or two-letter designation in the antenna code file, such
              antenna(s) will be excluded from viewing. If this line is empty or contains no valid
              antenna designations, all baselines based on antenna list in the .vex file will be
              plotted.
              This feature allows to define any convenient subset of antennas for viewing.

lines 24-... Can contain anything. You can use them to make notes of the particular viewing session
             or save the paths to experiments you often revisit.  
                 
####################################################################################################
                                    GUI DESCRIPTION AND CONTROLS:

                                          GUI main field

When the GUI opens (please, be patient, it takes several seconds to open or refresh each view
because several thousand buttons are being generated), you see a large grid of "elements" of
different colors. Horizontal rows correspond to different scans, each labeled at the extreme left
and extreme right with the scan number and source name (e.g. 0006:3C454.3). Vertical columns
correspond to baseline-polarization instances. Baselines are labeled (at the extreme top and
extreme bottom of the field) by two letters, one for each antenna of the baseline, e.g. BG for
Ef-Gb baseline or fl for Fd-La. Two-letter codes must be the same as in the vex file, but one-letter
codes used by AMON are defined in the included antenna code file, so they can be easily changed.
There are two columns for each baseline, the left one for the "left" polarization and the right one
for the "right". In the default parallel hands view "left" is LL and "right" is RR. If you switch
to the cross hands view, "left" becomes LR and "right" RL. You can always check the scan,
source, baseline and polarization information for each element (along with other useful info,
see below for the full description) by hovering the mouse pointer over it and reading the "status"
line at the bottom of the GUI.

If there are many scans and baselines, the whole view may be larger than the GUI size. In this case
you can use vertical (at the right) and horizontal (at the bottom) scroll bars to navigate around
the field.

                            Opening fplots and saving their pdf copies
                                 ( element buttons and [PDF copy] )

By pressing each "active" element (i.e. raised and with any color other than white or blue)
you open a separate window with the standard fourfit's fplot for this correlation. You can open as
many windows as you like and, when no longer needed, either close them in the usual way or leave
in the background: all of them will be automatically closed after the GUI is closed.
If you check the box [PDF copy] at the bottom right, each time when you click an active element
not only a view of the fplot is opened, but also a pdf hard copy of this plot is saved in the
current directory, with the unique name like c172c_No0006_3C454.3_XY_LL.pdf based on the experiment
name, scan number, source, baseline and polarization. 

                                             Controls

                                             [REPLOT]

There are 5 main controls (all at the top of the GUI) and the check box at the bottom right that
define the current view. Note, that whatever changes you make using these controls happen ONLY
AFTER you push the [REPLOT] button at the top right.

                                [MODE:] FRINGE. XPOL, SBD, DRATE

The leftmost [MODE:] switch selects one of four view modes of AMON. In each of these modes
the same elements are displayed, but they are colored differently. For all modes each active
element is assigned an integer value in the range 0-9 and colored in accordance with this value
(0 is bright red, 9 is bright green and 1-9 are different shades of colors ranging from dark red
to dark green, the greener -- the larger, the redder -- the smaller). If fourfit generated
an error code, its designation is depicted over the element, the same in all modes, even if element
is inactive. You can find the description of all the fourfit errors and their letter codes below.

Elements present in the .vex file, but not in .alist (i.e. not observed, not correlated or not
run through fourfit) are shown as white and inactive. You can still read their basic info.
If you launch AMON with only .vex, but not .alist file, all elements are displayed like this.
See below about a different kind of inactive elements -- light blue colored.

                                            FRINGE

The default viewing mode. For the FRINGE mode the 0-9 value is just the fringe quality code
assigned by fourfit. It simply shows which elements have fringes and how good they are.

                                             XPOL

The XPOL is the messiest one, here the value is based on comparison of the SNR in parallel hands to
SNR in cross hands. In the parallel hands view first we calculate the ratio of the SNR of the
element to the average of the cross-hands SNRs. I.e. for a LL element we calculate
SNR_LL/(0.5(SNR_LR+SNR_RL)). In the cross-hands view we calculate the ratio to the average of
parallel hands SNRs. I.e. for a LR element we calculate SNR_LR/(0.5(SNR_LL+SNR_RR)). But also
a number of exceptions is handled. If in the reference view (i.e. cross-hands for parallel and
vice versa) only one fringe exists, we care only about it. E.g. in the example above, if there
is a fringe for LR, but not in RL, we calculate SNR_LL/SNR_LR. The same applies if both reference
fringes exist, but one SNR is 3 times larger than the other -- we only care about the reference
element with the largest SNR.

After the ratio is calculated, it is compared with the range [1.15, 5] and logarithmically mapped
to 0-9, i. e. if the ratio is less than 1.15, the value is 0, if more than 5 -- it is 9, and the
values 1-8 are logarithmically distributed in between.

One more important special case is considered: if there are no cross-hands fringes, but at least
one parallel fringe, both LR and RL get 0, and the one or both LL/RR elements with fringe get 9;
similarly, if there are no parralel-hands fringes, but at least one cross fringe, both LL and RR
get 0, and the one or both LR/RL elements with fringe get 9.   

Despite this long and complicated description, using it is very simple: ideally in the parallel
hands view all elements with non-zero fringe codes should be green or greenish, in the cross-hands
view -- the opposite, all should be red or reddish. If an antenna consistently shows red elements
in XPOL parallel hands, but green elements in in XPOL cross hands, it should be investigated,
there is something wrong with its polarization setup. 

                                          SBD and DRATE 

Both these modes are based on the same principle: the value of the residual single-band delay or
delay rate of the element is compared with the reference value set in the config file.
If the SBD or DRATE exceed the reference value (of course, in absolute value, signs are ignored),
they get 0, values very close to zero get 9 and the rest is linearly mapped to 1-8, with
larger, "greener" values corresponding to SBD or DRATE being closer to zero.

These views allow to spot problems with clocks for a particular antenna and in general the
reliability of determined fringes.

                                  [Ref. Ant.:] ALL, <antennas>

The second from the left switch. Allows to either choose all antennas, or to pick one antenna
and display only the baselines to it.

                                       [Pol.:] LL RR, LR RL

The third from the left switch. Allows to switch between parallel-hands and cross-hands views.


                                      [Src.:] ALL, <sources>

The fourth from the left switch. Allows to either choose all scans, or to pick only scans
where one particular source was observed.  


                           [Top row (0-XXX):] <int in the allowed range>

This control is often disabled, displaying [Top row (disabled):] 0. It becomes active only if
the number of elements is so large, that the GUI is not able to display them all. Then it displays
only a number of the scans starting from the first one. To view more, one needs to enter a number
in the displayed allowed range (if you enter something else, it is automatically adjusted). E.g.
to view the last scans one needs to enter the largest number. This number IS NOT the scan number,
it is just related to the total number of rows in the experiment.
                                             
                                         [require fringe]

Finally, the [require fringe] check box at the bottom right (checked by default) marks with cyan
and renders inactive all elements, for which fourfit fringe quality was determined to be 0,
i.e. no fringe found. This is especially important in the modes other than FRINGE, because
for them this filters out many elements that are "red" for the trivial reasons.

You can uncheck this box either if you want to access the fplots for elements with no fringe
detected or if you prefer red color for "no fringe" designation in the FRINGE view.


                                           [PRINT PDF]
        [Print Size:] small A4L, normal A4L, large A4L, small A4P, normal A4P, large A4P

These controls (bottom left and third from the right) allow you to save your current field view
for posterity. Depending on the size of the field one or more pdf pages are generated and merged
into one file. For a large experiment and large printing size the number of pages may be quite
large and generating and merging them takes some time, please be patient. During the "printing"
the GUI is inactive, but you can follow the progress of this operation by looking at messages
displayed in the terminal window.

Each page is essentially a replica a part of the GUI main field, and all of them together allow to
reconstruct the whole field, with the same scan labels left and right, same baseline labels top and
bottom, and same element colors.

Two important exceptions:

1) the size of a scan label is limited to 13 symbols, so if the source name is long, it will be
   truncated when printed;

2) if the row limitation is in force, regulated by the [Top row (0 - XXX):] control, it is ignored,
   ALL the rows that should have been present in the current view without the row limitation WILL
   be printed.

You can choose out of 6 printing formats, all A4, three in landscape (A4L) and three in portrait
(A4P) orientation. "small", "normal" and "large" describe the printed element size. Here is
a table of how many scans and baselines can be fit into one page for each of these formats

                max no. scans per page       max no. baselines per page

small  A4L             46                                42
normal A4L             36                                32
large  A4L             31                                27
small  A4P             69                                26
normal A4P             52                                19
large  A4P             47                                17

The default printing format is "small A4L" since it is usually the most efficient. But be mindful
that any row or column that exceeds the maximum number of rows/columns for the current page is
pushed to the next one and sometimes this leads to just one or two rows/columns "hanging" in
separate pages. In this case one should consider switching the printing format. Of course, the
portrait orientation is preferable for cases with few baselines but lots of scans (like when a
reference antenna is chosen) and landscape -- with few scans and lots of baselines (like when only
one source is chosen).

Each printed page has a title like "AMON v.1.2a: [FRINGE] c172c Rf ant: Ef, src: 0716+714, ||.",
defining the AMON version and view mode used, experiment name, reference antenna, source and
parallel or cross-hands. If there are more than one page, page info is added, like
"Pg#2: rw=2, cl=1." It lists the page number in the merged multi-page pdf and, most importantly,
page row and column position in the whole field of view. This means that if you wish to reconstruct
the field, you need to put each page into its designated row and column position on a large table
surface.

Just displays this help file and linked to it current antenna code file and config file in a
separate window.

First line: experiment name, scan number, source, baseline, polarization, timestamp,
            fringe quality (0-9), error code, fplot location (scan dir and file name)

Second line: four SNR values for all the polarizations of this combination of scan and baseline,
             (in the order LL|RR LR|RL), residual single-band delay in usec, and residual delay rate
             in psec/sec.

                                         ELEMENT COLORS:

WHITE (unclickable button):   Present in the .vex file, but not in the .alist, i. e. not observed,
                              not correlated or not processed with Fourfit.
                               
CYAN  (unclickable button):   Flagged. Fourfit fringe quality code is 0 and the option "require
                              fringes" is checked, so this element is rendered inactive.   
                               
YELLOW                        Mouse pointer at this element, its properties are displayed at the
                              two bottom "status lines" of the main GUI window.
                               
MAGENTA                       Can only happen in XPOL mode and indicates NaN. This means that the
                              cross-polarization "strength" calculation failed because one or more
                              parallel or cross-polarization correlation results (LL, RR, LR, RL)
                              for this scan and baseline are not present in this dataset.
                               
BRIGHT RED                    Corresponds to 0 values, the "worst".

BRIGHT GREEN                  Corresponds to 9 values, the "best".

DARK RED, BROWN, DARK GREEN   Correspond to values 1-8,
(8 different shades)          more red -- lower, "worse",
                              more green -- higher, "better".

                                FOURFIT LETTER ERROR CODES:
                      
These are displayed on each element, for which Fourfit generated an error.                      

B   Interpolation error
D   No data in one or more frequency channels.
E   Maximum fringe amplitude at the edge of SBD, MBD, or rate window.
F   Fork problem in processing.
G   Fringe amp in a channel is <.5 times mean amp (only if SNR > 20).
H   Low phase-cal amplitude in one or more channels.
N   No valid correlator data.

                          TWO OR MORE CORRELATION JOBS FOR ONE SCAN:

Sometimes one scan can be broken into two correlation jobs. If during the reading of .alist
AMON finds the same scan-baseline combination for two correlations, it generates two
scan designations (e.g. 0225#1:3C454.3 and 0225#2:3C454.3) and displays them as if they were
two different scans, with separate links to correlation results, fplot files etc.
Vex-only ("white") elements are not duplicated, they stay assigned only to the first of these scans
(since the second one was not really scheduled).

If the same scan-baseline combination is found corresponding to 3 or more correlations, only
the first two will be prepared for visualization, for the others lots of scary warnings with
lots of exclamation marks will be issued during the initialization stage.
