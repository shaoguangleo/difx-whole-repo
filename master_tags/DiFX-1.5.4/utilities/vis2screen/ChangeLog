* Version for DiFX-1.5.3
* No change for DiFX-1.5.4

Version 0.1
~~~~~~~~~~
* First time version information started being tracked
* Added plotDiFX.py and diffDiFX.py for comparing DiFX output files directly in a "dumb" manner, and started this ChangeLog.  
* Previously, printDiFX and RPFitsReader were available for dumping some data to screen in order to inspect output files.
* Made Makefile.am a bit more useful, although it still doesn't compile RPFitsReader by default, since the rpfits libraries
might not be available
* This was the version for DiFX-1.5.2
