v103

  - Clock jumps in the ASC polys are retained; these jumps are 
    typically 1-2 microseconds, occuring between each 60s polynomial segment.
    This may be closer to what ASC intended (provided that these jumps exist on purpose in ASC data)

v102

 -  When there is no ASC poly to matche the time range of an DiFX/CALC9 .im poly record,
    the nearest-in-time ASC poly is used. It is shifted ("extended") into the .im poly time range.

    Note 1: Time shifting the coefficients will yield a worse model - but still better than nothing.
    Note 2: Extrapolation/reinterpolation is not possible, because ASC polynomial segments are discontinuous.

v101

  - Removes clock jumps in ASC polys
    The first generated .im poly retains the 0th order coeff (delay) from DiFX/CALC9,
    higher order coefficients are copied from the ASC delay poly file.
    The second and later .im polys have a 0th order coeff equal to that of the 
    first poly plus the cumulative delay-deltas of each ASC polynomial.

  - Adds code (unused) for time-shifting of ASC poly coefficients
