The files in this directory are exact copies of those from NVI's git repo (https://github.com/nvi-inc/vex), with just a couple exceptions:

1. The file in this directory called "vex_parse.y" corresponds to NVI's "vex.y"

2. The .c files and vex.yy.l in this directory include "vex_parse.tab.h" instead of "y.tab.h"

The following two lines of shell commands will convert the NVI files to those wanted here:

  sed -i 's/y.tab.h/vex_parse.tab.h/' *.c vex.yy.l
  mv -f vex.y vex_parse.y

Any changes made to the source files here should be communicated to the AUTHOR of this package who will coordinate the changes with NVI / NASA Goddard.
