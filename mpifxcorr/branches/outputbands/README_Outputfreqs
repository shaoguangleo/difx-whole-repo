Custom DiFX output bands feature adds another layer of "band abstraction".

Example:

   REC   |-recorded freq-| |-recorded freq-| |-recorded freq-|

   ZOOM  |-zoom-| |-zoom-|                   |-zoom-| |-zoom-|

   OUTPUT         |--------custom output freq-------|
                        zoom + recorded + zoom

   Recorded and zoom freqs are to be processed in DiFX internally
   in the same way as in DiFX-2.5.

   Internally produced visibilities/spectral data have to be routed
   into proper spots in a larger common spectral storage area,
   assigned to a new invented frequency.

Changes:

== v2d ==

   ZOOM gets renamed to CUSTOMFREQS

      addZoomFreq=...     syntax as before, freq@1810.0/bw@4.0[/specAvg@4][/noparent@true]

      addOutputFreq=...   new, syntax like addZoomFreq except the 'noparent' option is removed

   The zoom freqs are not necessarily output to disk. If a zoom or recorded freq is located
   within a defined output freq, that zoom/recorded freq is not independently written to disk.
 
   Output freq spectral cover completeness has to be checked by vex2difx. For convenience, any not yet
   explicitly defined zoom bands necessary to cover the output freq(s) could be auto-introduced.

== .input ==

   FREQ table

      include frequency entry for every 'addOutputFreq'
      
      note: for now upper sideband only; could envision lower sideband as well 

   DATASTREAM table

      expand the existing abstraction level

      support a new keyword 'DST FREQ INDEX'

== vex2difx ==

    - parse 'addOutputFreq', store in a new internal table

    - check for output freq cover, can it be produced from the recorded and explicit zoom bands

    - production of FREQ table has to use recorded, zoom, and output freq lists

== mpifxcorr ==

    - logic to allocate the proper amount of scratch space

    - augment Config::isFrequencyUsed(), Config::isEquivalentFrequencyUsed() with a new function
      that determines if visibility data of freq should land in procslots[idx].results[]

    - add logic to map a narrow Frequency into the correct spectral bin range of a wider Frequency,
      could use zoom band logic and allow it to work in the other direction

    - weight of outputfreq must be arithmetic or other mean of weights of its constituent bands,
      since some the underlying recorded bands might have had data loss (non-equal weights)

    - change the site where normalization is carried out
      Data weights are normalized in DiFX-2.5 at FxManager-level into the final spectra.
      Since some bands contributing to an outputfreq can have data loss, the normalization
      ought to be moved up into Core and be done early, on a per-band basis

    - additional spectral averaging at Outputfreq level should take place in Core(?)

== difx2fits ==

    - FQ table construction should look at BASELINE and collect frequencies of
      the referred DATASTREAM pairs, looked up via 'DST FREQ INDEX' rather than
      via 'REC FREQ INDEX' / 'ZOOM FREQ INDEX'

== difx2mark4 ==

    - freq table construction should look at BASELINE and collect frequencies of
      the referred DATASTREAM pairs, looked up via 'DST FREQ INDEX' rather than
      via 'REC FREQ INDEX' / 'ZOOM FREQ INDEX'

Open:

    - LSB outputfreqs, needed or not

      1) What if output freq is formed by an LSB-recorded band plus an USB ZOOM?
         Which one to flip?
 
      2) What if output freq is formed by two LSB-recorded bands?
         Keep it as LSB or flip it to USB?

    - Will any of this inadvertently affect the pulsar processing modes?

      Should there be checks in vex2difx to prohibit use of zoom & outputfreq
      when correlation is done in pulsar binning mode?

    - Are additions to wide field / multi-phasecenter code necessary?
