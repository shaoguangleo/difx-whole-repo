    <h1>Job Control Window<br>
    </h1>
    Each Job in the Queue Browser Window has a Job "Control/Monitor"
    Window
    associated with it.&nbsp; This window, which can be produced by
    picking
    the "Control/Monitor for [JOB NAME]" option in the Job menu (right
    click on a job in the Queue browser to raise this menu), contains
    all
    items required to tailor a DiFX job, and controls to actually run
    and
    monitor it.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span>Like<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>many DiFX GUI
    windows, the Control/Monitor Window is organized into "Sections"
    that
    can be opened or closed depending on whether you are interested in
    the
    details they contain.&nbsp; To open a section, click on its title
    bar.&nbsp; Click in the same location to close it.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <h3>"Input File" Section</h3>
    <p>This section has an editable window containing the text of the
      DiFX
      "input" file - the file read by <span style="font-style: italic;">difx</span>
      that governs a run.&nbsp; There is also a field showing the full
      path
      to the input file on the DiFX host, and two buttons:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> uploads the exact
        context of the text window to the DiFX host and places it in the
        location given by the full path.&nbsp; This can be done if any
        hand-editing changes have been made to the Input file (see the
        warning
        below about edits!).&nbsp; Unless this button is pushed, any
        editing
        changes you have made will have no effect.<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refresh</span> obtains the
        contents of the file (given by the full path) on the DiFX host
        and puts
        it in the editable text window.&nbsp; This can be done if you
        make
        changes that you don't like or are unsure of.&nbsp; All of your
        changes
        will be lost.&nbsp; Note that "Refresh" can only undo changes
        made
        since that last "Save".<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Warning:</span>&nbsp; The text
    field
    allows you to edit the Input file, but remember that <span
      style="font-style: italic;">difx</span> depends on this file to
    run
    properly.&nbsp; Because the original is automatically generated
    there
    is not a lot of format-checking of the content or clear and concise
    error reporting if anything you put in there is incorrect - <span
      style="font-style: italic;">difx</span> may just blow up.&nbsp;
    Don't
    mess around with this file unless you really know what you are
    doing.<br>
    <h3>"Calc File" Section</h3>
    <p>This section is identical to the "Input File" section except that
      it
      holds the "calc" file (used for...uh...what is it used
      for?).&nbsp; The
      same controls are available and the same warnings apply.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>"Machines List" Section</h3>
    <p>The Machines List section provides controls that can be used to
      select the data sources and processors used to process the
      job.&nbsp;
      Selections are used to produce "Machines" and "Threads" files on
      the
      DiFX host which are used by <i>mpirun</i> to control
      multiprocessing.&nbsp; The .machines and .threads files can be
      generated using the "Apply" button, and then examined in the "<a
        href="#MACHINES_FILE_SECTION">Machines File</a>" and "<a
        href="#THREADS_FILE_SECTION">Threads File</a>" sections as
      outlined
      below.&nbsp; Alternatively the "Apply" button can be ignored and
      the
      .machines and .threads files will be generated automatically when
      the
      job is started.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Machines List Section has two primary panels which govern
      "Data
      Sources" (which machines are used as the source of data for each
      antenna involved in a correlation) and "Processors" (which
      machines are
      devoted to round-robin DiFX processing).<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <h4>Data Sources</h4>
    <p>The purpose of the Data Sources section is to allow the user to
      select the machines that will serve as the "source" of data for
      each
      station involved in a correlation.&nbsp; For "MODULE" data types
      the
      data source will be the Mark5 unit that contains the required
      module.&nbsp; For "FILE" data types the data source will be the
      machine
      that reads the data files off of disk.&nbsp; A "NETWORK" data
      source is
      the machine that serves as the network destination of a data
      stream
      from a remote source.&nbsp; Each station involved in a correlation
      can
      have only one data source machine assigned to it, and ideally each
      station will have a <i>different</i> machine assigned to it.<br>
    </p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <p>The Data Sources panel includes a section for each station.&nbsp;
      These sections differ somewhat depending on the type of data
      source
      being used.&nbsp; Different stations can use different data source
      types, however for the moment it is assumed that all of the data
      for a
      particular station will be using the same data source type.<br>
    </p>
    The following image shows the Data Sources panel for a two-station
    correlation.&nbsp; The first station uses a FILE data source, and
    the
    second station uses a MODULE data source:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="left">
      <div align="center"><img alt=""
          src="images/jobEditor/dataSources1.png" height="189"
          width="703"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      For each data source a pull-down menu is provided from which any
      appropriate available machine can be selected.&nbsp; This is the
      actual
      data source that will be included in the resulting .machines
      file.&nbsp; Following it is a checkbox labelled "Skip" that can be
      used
      to remove the station from the job (see <a
        href="#Removing_Stations_From_a_Job">Removing Stations From a
        Job</a>
      below), a column for the station involved (two letter
      abbreviation),
      the format for the data, and the data source type.&nbsp;
      Subsequent
      columns differ based on the data source type.<br>
      <h5>Initial Data Source Choice<br>
      </h5>
      When the Job Control Window is first opened, the GUI will have
      chosen
      what it feels are logical machine picks for each data
      source.&nbsp; For
      module data, a MarkV with the appropriate module will be used if
      it can
      be found.&nbsp; The machine for file data will be chosen based on
      several user settings (see <a
        href="settings_content.html#Data_Source_Defaults">Data Source
        Defaults</a>
      in the Job Processing Settings of the Settings Window), an option
      among
      which is a specific assignment based on path.<br>
    </div>
    <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">FILE Data Sources</span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </h5>
    A file can be read by any data source that has access to the file,
    thus
    the source selection pull-down menu provides everything seen on the
    DiFX cluster, including processors and Mark5 units (some of these
    machines may not have access to the storage system containing the
    file,
    but unfortunately the GUI has no way of knowing this).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/jobEditor/dataSources2.png" height="185" width="701"><br>
    </p>
    <p>The last column of a FILE data source line shows the first in the
      list of files that contain the data for the antenna (usually one
      file
      for each scan).&nbsp; This list can be expanded to see all of the
      files.&nbsp; The names of the files are obtained from the "DATA
      TABLE"
      section of the .input file.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/jobEditor/dataSources3.png" height="185" width="702"><br>
    </p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>If the "DATA TABLE" section
    of
    the .input file does not contain anything (this can happen of the
    data
    for a station were listed in a <a
      href="experimentEditor_content.html#Using_a_File_List">File List</a>
    and <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> failed to
    find
    appropriate data files), the data are considered "missing" and the
    data
    source will be outlined in red.<br>

    This job will not process correctly, however there is a way to
    repair
    it - see <a href="#Removing_Stations_From_a_Job">Removing Stations

        style="font-weight: bold;">Data Sources</span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </h5>
    A module data source can only be a machine capable of reading a
    module
    - a Mark5 unit.&nbsp; The pull down menu for a module data type
    includes only the Mark5 machines that can be seen on the DiFX
    cluster.
    <p align="center"><img alt=""

    <p align="left">The VSNs of modules installed in each Mark5 are
      listed
      in the pull down menu - the Mark5 unit containing the VSN required
      for
      the experiment and antenna should be chosen as the data
      source.&nbsp;
      If the required VSN is not installed in the current data source
      the VSN
      name will be colored <font color="#ff0000">red</font>, as in the
      image
      above.&nbsp; If the data source does contain the correct module
      the VSN
      name will be colored <font color="#3333ff">blue</font> (see the
      previous images).<br>

      Job<br>
    </h5>
    <dl>
      <dt>It may be desirable to run a job without one of its
        associated stations.&nbsp; The most obvious situation where this
        would
        be the case would be when the data for a station was "missing"
        for some
        reason.&nbsp; In the example pictured below, the data source for
        the
        station "KE" is missing because the .input file had no data
        associated
        with it (it would have been "D/STREAM 1" in the .input
        file).&nbsp;
        Running DiFX on this job will result in an error.&nbsp; To draw
        attention to this situation, the Data Source menu has outlined
        the KE
        station data in red.</dt>

    To remove the missing station from the experiment (or to remove any
    other station, if desired), check the "Skip" box associated with it,

        name="What_Is_The_GUI_Doing_Rebuild"></a>What is the GUI Doing
      When it Rebuilds a Job?</h5>
    To "rebuild" a job that runs with a different set of stations, the
    GUI
    has to
    create an entirely new set of job-specific files, including the
    .input
    file, the
    .calc file, and some others.&nbsp; This is done by creating a new,
    job-specific .v2d file (based on the .v2d file for the experiment)
    with
    the station selections, then running <span style="font-style:
      italic;">vex2difx</span> on it to create the new job files.&nbsp;
    Before running <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>,
    existing files are first renamed with ".0" appended to their
    original
    name for the first rebuild, ".1" for the second rebuild, etc, so
    nothing is thrown away.&nbsp; The list of files for a job named "JOB
    NAME" that are renamed (if they exist) are [JOB NAME].calc, [JOB
    NAME].difxlog, [JOB NAME].flag, [JOB NAME].im, [JOB NAME].difx (a
    directory), [JOB NAME].input, [JOB NAME].machines, [JOB
    NAME].threads,
    and [MANGLED JOB NAME].v2d (from a previous rebuild).&nbsp; The
    "MANGED
    JOB NAME" of the .v2d file matches the JOB NAME of other files
    except
    that all underscores have been replaced by hyphens (<span
      style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> does not permit
    underscores in the .v2d file name).<br>
    <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Automating
        the Rebuild Procedure</span></h5>
    When data for a station are missing from a job it is often the case
    that the job is part of a large, many-job experiment, where, for
    whatever reason, some portion of the data for a scheduled station
    does
    not exist.&nbsp; In this case it may be many jobs that will have to
    be
    rebuilt and re-run.&nbsp; The GUI scheduling system can be set to
    recognize when a scheduled job fails to run due to missing data,
    rebuild the job with the offending station omitted, and re-run the
    job
    automatically.&nbsp; In fact, this is the default behavior of the
    scheduler.&nbsp; See <a
      href="main_window_content.html#Running_Jobs_With_the_Scheduler">Running
      Jobs With the Scheduler</a> and <a
      href="settings_content.html#Scheduler_Settings">Scheduler Settings</a>.<br>

      <dd>When <i>guiServer</i> on the DiFX host creates the Machines

        execute an <i>mpirun</i> on the specific host.&nbsp; If a

    <h5>General Guidelines<br>
    </h5>
    <dl>
      <dt>In general you have complete flexibility in which machines you
        choose to do what, although the GUI will try to alert you if you
        request something that won't work.&nbsp; Given that, there are a
        number
        of ways you can wisely choose your machines such that your
        correlation
        processing is more efficient.<br>
      </dt>
    </dl>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>With some exceptions (such as situations where you have
      no
      choice) a machine should not appear in both the Data Sources and
      Processors list.</blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Each antenna should, if possible, have an independent
      data
      source associated with it.&nbsp; The nature of correlation
      requires
      that data will be required for all antennas <i>simultaneously</i>
      and
      having more than one antenna on a data source will cause that
      source to
      swap inefficiently between files.</blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>If possible the head node should have a dedicated
      machine
      (not just a single thread on a machine).&nbsp; The head node
      should not
      appear in the list of processors.</blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>If a processor machine has <i>n</i> cores, assign at
      most <i>n
        - 1</i> threads to it.&nbsp; The GUI will try to do this
