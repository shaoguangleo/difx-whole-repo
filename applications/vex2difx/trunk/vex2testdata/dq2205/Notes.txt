There are many MODEs here and consequently many DATASTREAMS and IF and EXTENSIONS blocks.

A new "extension" is employed when using the "90cm" receiver.  I have named it "filter50cm".  
The value of "5 MHz" corresponds to "NARROW" in the old "if_def" comment line and "33 MHz"
corresponds to "BROAD".  In practice, "NARROW" should be assumed for a value less than 8 MHz, 
"BROAD" should be asusmed for a value > 24 MHz.
