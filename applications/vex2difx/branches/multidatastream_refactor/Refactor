Goal: all data from which difx schedules are derived come from VexTables

Exceptions: zoom bands, machines


Urgent:

* revisit clocks (especially poly model)

* VDIF: nthread = 1 or set by ::::'s ;  nChanPerThread = nRecordChan / nThread

* The removedAntennas list needs to be restored in makeJobs

* calculateJobSize needs help

Eventually:

* RECORD flag... how to handle?
  - Handled OK for now.  Eventually maybe RECORD flags should be done per datastream???

* zoom bands are property of corrparams
  - OK for now.  Eventually migrate to VexSetup

* name mappings (sources, antennas, ...) as specified in v2d file end up in a renaming map

To test:

* shelves
* clock offsets
* LO offsets
* polarization swap
* various ways to specify VDIF format


Operate rules from v2d onto vex structure
 - setups/modes and scans using them
 - sources and the scans they are in?
 - explicit scan names?
