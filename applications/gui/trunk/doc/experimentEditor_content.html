    <h1>Experiment Editor<br>
    </h1>
    The Experiment Editor allows you to create a new DiFX experiment (or
    "session"), optionally containing a pass and/or a list of
    jobs.&nbsp; It also allows an existing experiment to be edited and
    new passes and job sets to be created.&nbsp; All directory
    structures and files associated with the experiment are created on
    the DiFX host, as well as in the DiFX database (if it is being
    used), and the experiment, pass(es), and job(s) are listed on the
    Queue Browser on the GUI from where DiFX can be run.<br>
    <br>
    As a user you control the specifics of a DiFX job using two files -
    the ".vex" file, which describes your observations, and the ".v2d"
    file, which (loosely) describes how you wish DiFX to process those
    observations (these definitions with apologies to the DiFX creators
    who defined these files and can certainly better - and perhaps
    differently - describe what they do).&nbsp; The Experiment Editor
    needs to be provided with a .vex file - one was presumably made
    available with your observations.&nbsp; Almost all of what the
    Experiment Editor does involves creating a detailed .v2d file.&nbsp;
    The .v2d file is then used by the <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>
    application to produce a ".input" file - which in turn can be used
    to run DiFX.&nbsp; There are associated files and directory
    structures that are created as well, and some other details are seen
    to, but the point to take away is that until you hit the "Apply"
    button on the Experiment Editor you are using it to define a .v2d
    file.<br>
    <br>
    Alternatively, specified as an outline, the steps to creating a new
    DiFX experiment with the Experiment Editor involve:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Specify where your experiment will go and what it will be
        called</li>
      <li>Get a .vex file</li>
      <li>Detail all of the stuff that goes into the .v2d file</li>
      <li>Hit "Apply" to generate the specified directory and dump the
        .vex and .v2d file in it<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    The Experiment Editor is launched either to create a new experiment
    (by picking "New" from the Queue Browser) in which case its title is
    "Create New Experiment", or to edit an existing experiment (by
    right-clicking on the experiment name in the Queue Browser and
    choosing "Edit Properties") in which case its title is "Edit
    Experiment Properties".&nbsp; While the controls are identical,
    applying changes to an existing experiment has slightly different
    effects than those applied to a new experiment, as described below.<br>
    <h3>Some General Information</h3>
    <p>The Experiment Editor controls are organized in <a
        href="widgets_content.html#Hierarchical_Indexed_Panels">hierarchical


        indexed panels</a>, with a small number of "top level" panels
      that can be opened or closed based on whether you are interested
      in them or not.&nbsp; The "Identification Data" panel at the top
      of the Editor and the "Apply/Cancel" panel at the bottom are
      "permanent" - they cannot be closed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Many of the settings in the Experiment Editor are "remembered" if
      you run it a subsequent time (and even between sessions of running
      the GUI).&nbsp; This is done to ease repetitive tasks, making the
      assumption that any time you run the Experiment Editor, a very
      good guess for the way you wish to run it is somewhat similar to
      the way you last ran it.&nbsp; For the most part this should save
      you time, however it bears watching here and there.&nbsp; If you
      change a setting that you never touch and don't even fully
      understand the consequences of just for fun, it may very well <span
        style="font-style: italic;">stay</span> changed until you
      actively undo it.</p>
    <p>Nothing happens to the DiFX host, the database, or your
      experiments until you hit the "Apply" button, so don't worry about
      playing with the controls (bearing in mind the caveat in the
      previous paragraph).&nbsp; You can always "Cancel" and start again
      if you get in a position you can't figure out how to back out of.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="IDENTIFICATION_DATA"></a>Identification Data<br>
    </h3>
    <p>The experiment name, ID, directory, and some other items are used
      to uniquely identify an experiment and to access it in the
      database.&nbsp; Some of these items are not changed after the
      experiment is created, others can be but generally aren't, and
      some are meant to be changed.&nbsp; They are contained in the top
      section of Experiment Editor.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span><br>
      This is the name of the experiment which appears in the Queue
      Browser.&nbsp; When an experiment is initially created, a default
      name will be generated - a combination of the word "Experiment"
      and the Database ID number.&nbsp; It can be changed to reflect
      something that better describes the experiment to the user.&nbsp;
      Due to restrictions imposed by the database, a 20 character limit
      is placed on the name length.&nbsp; Changes to the name are
      propagated to the "Directory" and ".vex File" parameters, unless
      those items have been previously changed (you have to hit return
      to make changes do this).<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number</span><br>
      The number is contained in the database, and I'm not sure what it
      is.&nbsp; I'll get back to you on this one.&nbsp; This is <span
        style="font-style: italic;">not</span> the database ID.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span><br>
      The status describes the current state of the experiment<span
        style="font-style: italic;"></span>.&nbsp; No doubt this will be
      used by the GUI in the future, but for the moment it is simply
      something the user can set for their own tracking purposes.&nbsp;
      If the database is being used the options permitted by the
      database are given for status.&nbsp; If no database is being used
      the status currently doesn't work and can't be changed, but
      ultimately a way of allowing the user to specify their own status
      strings will be implemented.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In Database</span><br>
      This check box will determine whether the experiment is put in the
      database (for experiments that are already created, it will
      indicate whether they exist in the database).&nbsp; If the
      database is not being used, this item should remain
      unchecked.&nbsp; An experiment that was not, for whatever reason,
      originally created with this item checked can later be put in the
      database by checking it.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Database ID</span><br>
      This is the unique ID generated by the database to track the
      experiment.&nbsp; When an experiment is initially created, a
      "guess" for this number is generated (usually it is a pretty good
      guess).&nbsp; Later if the experiment is edited the number will
      accurately reflect the ID used by the database.&nbsp; If the
      database is not being used, the original guess is retained.&nbsp;
      This number cannot be changed by the user.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Created</span><br>
      This field contains the creation time and date for the
      experiment.&nbsp; When a new experiment is created, the field will
      show the local time of the GUI host at the moment the Experiment
      Editor was opened.&nbsp; Once the experiment is put in the
      database, this time will change (hopefully not much) to reflect
      the actual creation time on the database host.&nbsp; This is not a
      user-settable item.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Working Directory</span><br>
      This is the "working directory" on the DiFX host under which all
      files and sub-directories associated with an experiment
      reside.&nbsp; It should be an absolute (not relative) path name -
      starting with a "/".&nbsp; When an experiment is created, this
      directory is created on the DiFX host (if necessary).&nbsp; If
      this parameter is later changed, it will cause the directory to be
      moved on the DiFX host.&nbsp; For either of these operations to
      occur, the DiFX user must have write permission to do them on the
      DiFX host.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">.vex File</span><br>
      This is the name of the <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      file that will be stored (if creating a new experiment) or is
      already stored (if editing an experiment) under the working
      directory.&nbsp; A session of the Experiment Editor may work with
      only one <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file
      at a time, however any number of <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">.vex</span> files may be associated with an
      experiment.&nbsp; The data stored in the <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file is obtained
      using the "Get .vex File Content" as described in the next
      section.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you already have a <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      file associated with an experiment and wish to create a new one,
      enter a new name in this field and obtain new content using "Get
      .vex File Content".&nbsp; If you have several <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> files associated
      with an experiment and wish to use a previous one, the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Previous Files</span> button can be
      used to load it.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Starting <tt>.v2d</tt> File<br>
    </h3>
    <h3>Get <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> File
      Content</h3>
    <p>An experiment is associated with at least one <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file - in most cases
      only one (although more can be added).&nbsp; The <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file contains a
      complete description of an observing session, including times,
      frequencies, antennas used, sources observed, and scans collected
      (as well as other things).&nbsp; The GUI uses the <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file to provide the
      user with the options that may be applied to tailor DiFX
      processing of the observations.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If you are creating a new experiment, you need a <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file before you can
      go anywhere.&nbsp; Any set of observations should have an
      associated <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file
      supplied with them (or provide some way of producing a
      file).&nbsp; The "Get .vex File Content" of the Experiment Editor
      provides you with a number of ways of obtaining <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file data,
      including:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grabbing a file from a location on the DiFX Host.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a file via HTTP.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a file via FTP.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Using a file on the GUI Host.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Copying a file used in another experiment.</li>
    </ol>
    Note that when you pick a .vex file in this interface (when you hit
    "Go"), you are getting the <span style="font-style: italic;">content</span>
    of the source you specify - the source itself is <span
      style="font-style: italic;">not</span> used for your
    experiment.&nbsp; The content is stored in the file location
    specified in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">.vex File</span>
    field in the Identification Data section (see above) when the
    "Apply" button is hit.<br>
    <h3><span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> File Editor</h3>
    <p>The .vex File Editor panel provides a view of the .vex file
      content - the text that is written to the .vex file on the DiFX
      host (and that ultimately governs how DiFX will be run).&nbsp; The
      panel was created to support GUI development, and may be removed
      in the future.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The "Alternate Editor" button doesn't do anything.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The content can be edited (the panel is a rudimentary editor with
      cut, copy and paste capabilities), bearing in mind that <span
        style="font-style: italic;">no effort is made to check edits for
        sanity</span>.&nbsp; Any changes are propagated verbatim to the
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file stored on
      the DiFX host, which is then used to produce <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.input</span> files that are
      read by DiFX when it runs.&nbsp; Typographic or logic errors in
      the <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> content can
      produce any number of obscure and opaque errors.&nbsp; Don't mess
      around with the <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
      file content unless you are confident you know what you are doing!<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Correlation Parameters</h3>
    <p>The Correlation Parameters section is something of a catch-all
      for items that don't fit neatly in any other sections.&nbsp; Most
      of these parameters end up in the "Setup" section of the .v2d
      file.<br>
    </p>
    <h6 style="margin-left: 40px;">Spectral Resolution/Channels<br>
    </h6>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is the spectral resolution of the
      visibilities produced by the correlation (in MHz).&nbsp; This
      should be the bandwidth divided by the number of channels.&nbsp;
      The "Channels" setting can be used to change the spectral
      resolution, although the reverse is not true.&nbsp; The reason for
      this is that the channels setting is limited to factors of 2 in
      the DiFX documentation, while the spectral resolution has no such
      limitations.&nbsp; Whether or not this makes any sense is another
      matter.<br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Stations</h3>
    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <h3>Scan Selection</h3>
    <h3>EOP Data</h3>
    <p><img style=" width: 830px; height: 310px;" alt=""
        src="images/experimentEditor/eop.png"><br>
    </p>
    Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP) data are necessary for a
    correlation process to run (they are required by <span
      style="font-style: italic;">calcif2</span>).&nbsp; The Experiment
    Editor provides EOP data, when available, from two different
    sources:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file
        may contain EOP data.&nbsp; Often these data are a "projection"
        into the future, as they are produced when observations occur
        (and before actual EOP measurements are made).&nbsp; They are
        usually reasonably accurate.</li>
      <li>EOP data is obtained from a URL, as specified in the Settings
        menu.&nbsp; If the URL is set up correctly, and the connection
        to the internet is good, these data should always be
        available.&nbsp; They will be at least as accurate as the
        "projected" data that may already exist in the <span
          style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file, and in fact
        may represent actual measurements and thus be better (they most
        likely will never be worse).&nbsp; The GUI updates these data
        when it is started and roughly every hour thereafter.</li>
    </ol>
    Data from either source can be selected using the check boxes next
    to the title bar for each source.&nbsp; Of the two sources, the
    updated EOP data are probably preferred (the Experiment Editor will
    pick them automatically when available), however there are
    imaginable circumstances where data from the <tt>.vex</tt> file may
    be preferred.&nbsp; For instance, it should be noted that because
    they are constantly updated the "Updated From Source" EOP
    measurements will <i>not</i> produce identical DiFX results for
    multiple runs on the same data.&nbsp; As stated before, changes will
    be small, and probably for the better, but they will not exactly
    match.&nbsp; If for some reason you need to eliminate changing EOP
    data as a source of changes in calculated results, use the <tt>.vex</tt>
    file EOP.<br>
    <h3>Names, Etc.</h3>
    <p>The Names section can be used to change the way <span
        style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> will name the input
      files it creates (an <tt>.input</tt> file is created for each
      "job").&nbsp; By default, the <span style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span>
      naming scheme is to use the "base" name of the vex file (e.g. "<tt>foo</tt>"
      for the file "<tt>foo.vex</tt>") with an appended integer followed
      by "<tt>.input</tt>".&nbsp; For the first input file created the
      appended integer will be 1; the integer will increment for
      subsequent input files.&nbsp; For instance, if the "<tt>foo.vex</tt>"
      file is used to create three jobs, their input files will be
      called "<tt>foo_1.input</tt>", "<tt>foo_2.input</tt>", and "<tt>foo_3.input</tt>".<br>
    </p>
    <p>If for some reason you don't like the default scheme, the Names
      section can give you some control over the names of the files that
      will be created.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>.v2d File</h3>
    <p>The .v2d file is the "configuration" file used by <span
        style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> to implement user
      adjustments when using the .vex file content to create one or more
      .input files.&nbsp; Most of the controls in the Experiment Editor
      are used to make changes to this file.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The .v2d File section shows the content the .v2d file that will
      be created in your working directory (when you hit "Apply").&nbsp;
      This content is continually updated as you make changes using
      other controls.&nbsp; If you feel confident you know what you are
      doing you can edit the content by hand, however any changes you
      make to other controls (any of those <span style="font-style:
        italic;">above</span> the .v2d file section in the GUI that is)
      will cause the .v2d content to be recreated and will erase your
      changes.&nbsp; If you need to change something by hand, do it
      last.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Applying Your Changes</h3>
    <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a New Pass (or not!)</span></h5>
    <h5><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine Scans in One Job</span></h5>
    <p> The GUI can create jobs out of the specified scans in one of two
      ways, either as a series of individual scans with one job per
      scan, or a single job containing all scans.&nbsp; Those who know <span
        style="font-style: italic;">vex2difx</span> well will recognize
      this as a slight change from what it does.&nbsp; <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Vex2difx</span> can be set to create
      single-scan jobs, but otherwise it arranges scans in one or more
      jobs based on the "maxGap" parameter - breaking into new jobs only
      when the gap between two correlations exceeds this value.&nbsp; In
      fact, the GUI essentially cheats by setting the "maxGap" parameter
      to something huge so scans are never broken into more than one
      job.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Status Bar<br>
    </h3>
    <h3>What is the GUI Doing?</h3>
    <p>When you hit the "Apply" button, the GUI "creates" jobs on the
      DiFX Host that can then be run.&nbsp; But what exactly is going
      on?&nbsp; Following is a step-by-step description of the
      operations performed.<br>
    </p>
    <h6 style="margin-left: 40px;">EOP Data</h6>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Your choice of source (either <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file or external
      URL) and the availability of EOP data will cause a number of
      things to happen.&nbsp; The following is a list of actions taken
      by the GUI based on what it can do, and what it is told to do
      (note that the GUI will not allow you to choose a source for which
      data are unavailable):<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">You choose the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file as the
            EOP source:</span> No EOP data will be installed in the <span
            style="font-family: monospace;">.v2d</span> file, and the <span
            style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file will be
          copied to the DiFX host as is, with its EOP data intact.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">EOP data are available <span
              style="font-style: italic;">ONLY</span> from the .vex
            file:</span> Same as above.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">You choose the&nbsp;
            external URL as the EOP source:</span> The EOP data in the <span
            style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> file is edited
          out before the file is copied to the DiFX host (this is the
          only instance where any changes are made to <span
            style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> files, but this
          action is necessary because combining EOP data from multiple
          sources is messy and dangerous).&nbsp; The EOP data from the
          external URL are put into the <span style="font-family:
            monospace;">.v2d</span> file.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">EOP data are available <span
              style="font-style: italic;">ONLY</span> from the external
            URL:</span> The <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span>
          file is copied unchanged.&nbsp; The EOP data from the external
          URL are put into the <span style="font-family: monospace;">.v2d</span>
          file.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">No EOP data available from
            either <span style="font-family: monospace;">.vex</span> or
            external URL:</span>&nbsp; Because a correlation won't run
          without EOP data, this is a "fail" condition.&nbsp; An error
          pop-up will be produced and no further "apply" actions will be
          taken.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
