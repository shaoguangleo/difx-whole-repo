COMMAND NAME:	psfile

TYPE:		Experiment summary

SYNTAX:		"psfile filename"

DESCRIPTION:

Writes a summary of the type-2 quality codes to the specified filename.
The output format is similar to the main sections of the HP1000 PS file
format.  However, the unix version displays only type-2 quality codes,
not type-1 codes.  It also lacks information about correlator hours and
processing factors.  The appropriate correlator control file must be 
present in memory before this command will work (see the ccread command).  
If the cc file is not present, "psfile" will look for the file in the
experiment directory and read it if possible.

Unlike the HP-1000 PS file, the output of this command is intended for
visual inspection only, and is not intended to be machine-readable.  It
provides some useful quality code statistics for diagnosing experiment
problems.  It should be used in conjunction with psplot for the most
comprehensive experiment assessment options.
