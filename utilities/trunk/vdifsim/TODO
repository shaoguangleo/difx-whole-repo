TODO

* Create new DiFX repo for this: vdifsim

* Parameterize a few things / couple with options:
  x SEFD
  - Default source brightness
  - Default filter parameters

* Spectrum model: 
  x shaped broadband noise
  ... tones (with appropriate doppler)
  - PNR

* Consider horizon

* Support complex-valued VDIF output

* Respect thread-id included in the format specifier

* Integrate with difxmessage?


STRETCH GOALS

* integrate with MPI
  - option 1: simply parallelize across .input files
  - option 2: divide up time range and combine VDIFs at end

* multi-phase-center -> source with structure

* SEFD depends on elevation

RESOLVED ISSUES

X Resolve phase/delay drift issue  (~10ns on long baselines)

X Add clock offsets

X get SEFD and flux density correct in _voltage_ units
