 * 	1: setinputFiles		- initialize the input file names
 * 	2: setreadChunks		- how big the input buffer from the disk shall be
 * 	3: set buffer_size		- the size of the read buffer
 * 							(how much data we shall keep in memory)
 * 	4: checkArguments	- make sure we are OK  with all inputs
 * 	5: startReader		- starts the input streams
 * 	6: while we need more data ()
 * 	6.1: getPacket()
 * 	6.2: (if packet == NULL check if we have EOF)
 * 	6.3: freePacket(pkt)	- signals the reader that it is OK to free buffer
 * 							  space taken by packet
 * 	6.4: until we do not need more data or EOF
 * 	7: stopReader()		- stops the reader threads
 * 	8: delete the packet reader ..                                           */
