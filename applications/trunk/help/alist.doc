Documentation for the program "alist"
-------------------------------------

COMMAND NAME:   alist

SYNOPSIS:  Makes A-format files that summarize correlator data files

SYNTAX:  alist [-ff] [-fr] [-o output file] [-v version] [data file list]
		 Where all arguments except the data file list are optional.
		 Note: all option flags must appear before the data file list

OPTION FLAGS:	-ff
			For type 2 files, summarize only those generated
			by the unix program fourfit, and ignore those
			generated by the HP1000 program FRNGE.  Ignored
			if -fr has already been specified.
		-fr
			For type 2 files, summarize only those generated
			by the HP1000 program FRNGE, and ignore those
			generated by the unix program fourfit.  Ignored
			if -ff has already been specified.
		-o outfile
			By default, alist writes its A-format output
			to a file in the current directory named
			"alist.out".  This flag provides a user
			override.  The output will go to the specified
			outfile.
		-v version
			This option forces alist to write the summarized
			data out in the A-file format version specified
			by the integer "version".  The default is the 
			highest version currently supported.

ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			This mandatory argument specifies the binary
			data files that "alist" should summarize.  It
			follows the standard MkIV data file specification
			format.  You may specify individual filenames,
                        scan directories which contain data files,
                        experiment directories, or any combination of
                        these three.  In the latter two cases,
                        alist will descend the directory tree looking for
                        data files to add to its internal list of files to
                        process.  Beware of trying to specify too many
			files or scan directories, as it is possible to
			overflow the Unix argument list buffer on large
			experiments.  In such cases, specify the experiment
			directory instead.  Coarse control of the data filtering
			is appropriate by using the data file list.  More
			sophisticated filtering is best left to "aedit".

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

Alist provides a 1-line summary of each binary data file supplied to it.
This file is suitable for immediate input to aedit or any other program
that recognizes the format.  At present, only type 2 fourfit fringe files
are supported.  Output formats range up through 5 (the current version).
