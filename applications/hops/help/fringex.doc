COMMAND NAME:  fringex

SYNOPSIS:  Segments and rotates output of fourfit

SYNTAX: fringex [-abcoq] [-i iarg] [-f freq] [-d rdarg]
		[-p ra,dec] [r afile] data file list
	where all option flags are optional, and the data file
	list is mandatory in the absence of the -r flag

	-a switches on execution time accounting
	-b specifies binary output mode (use only with "average -b")
	-c mode makes rate,delay,ra,dec offsets relative
	   to corel - rather than relative to the fourfit peak 
	-o includes segments shifted by half segment duration
	-q nsecs is in millisecs (special mode - times are fictitious)
	-i specifies segmentation time(s) (see detailed description)
	-f freq (MHz) redefines the frequency 
	   freq=-1 for reference frequency equal to channel nearest mean
	   freq=-2 for reference frequency equal to mean 
	-p ra,dec in arcsec are position offsets in all modes
	-d specifies rate/delay value(s) to be used (see detailed
	   description
	-r afile specifies a data list in A-file format
        
OPTION FLAGS: 	-a
			Switches on the standard HOPS execution time
			accounting package (a crude form of profiling)

		-b
			Normally, fringex generates A-format data in ascii
			form.  This data can then be read by any HOPS program
			that knows the A-file format.  The -b flag is a
			performance option which tells fringex to write the
			data out in the binary memory A-file format, skipping
			the ascii formatting step.  Only the "average" program
			knows how to deal with such data, and when invoked
			with its own -b flag can read the data without having
			to parse all the ascii fields.  The data flow between
			fringex and average can be very voluminous, and the
			formatting and parsing can be very time-consuming.  Use
			of matched -b flags and a unix pipe between these
			two programs cuts total execution time by roughly a
			factor of 6.
		-c
			If specified, any rate or delay offsets
			given by the -d flag are relative to corel,
			not the fourfit peak.  This is useful for
			steering the delay/rate window and generating
			arrays of delay vs. rate for searching.

		-o
			If specified, the output segments will overlap
			by 0.5 segments instead of being simply contiguous.
			This allows a modest SNR improvement to be
			realized when incoherently averaging the data.

		-q
			For some special situations, 1-second resolution
			is inadequate.  Fringex can segment finer than
			this, but the output format does not have
			enough resolution.  The -q mode allows the
			segment length to be specified in milliseconds.
			The segment time tags in this mode are
			fictitious, incrementing by 1 second each
			segment.

		-i iarg
			This flag and its argument specifies the
			requested segment length in seconds.  It is
			recommended that this be a multiple of the
			accumulation period of the data.  The default
			value is 9999 seconds, which the program
			interprets as the entire scan.  Instead of a
			single number, iarg can be a list of up to 15
			numbers, comma separated with no embedded
			spaces.  Fringex will perform one segmenting
			pass at each specified integration time,
			separating the output of each pass with the
			comment string "*endofscan".  The special
			string "all" tells fringex to use segment
			times of 1,2,4,8,... accumulation periods, and
			is a shorthand way of getting a well-sampled
			set of segmentation times for purposes of
			coherence time determination.
			The special forms "-i noloss" and "-i search"
			cause fringex to pick up the noloss and
			search coherence times repectively from the
			input A-file, and use the time found there
			for segmenting.  These options require the
			-r option.

		-f freq
			This flag overrides the determination of a
			suitable reference frequency for the segmenting.
			This must be within a factor of 2 of the scan
			reference frequency.  The default is to use the 
			scan reference frequency.
			A value of -1 uses the channel nearest to the 
			channel mean, while -2 uses the channel mean itself.

		-p ra,dec
			This flag specifies position offsets in arcseconds.
			These numbers must be separated by a comma, with
			no spaces.  The output data are rotated in 
			accordance with the position offsets.

		-d rate,delay
			This flag specifies rate and delay offsets.  The
			format has several forms:
			(i) rate,delay  This form specifies a single
					rate and delay offset in ps/s
					and ns respectively
			(ii) lowr,highr,rstep,lowd,highd,dstep
					This form specifies a grid in ps/s
					and ns.
			(iii) rxd       This form specifies an r times d
					grid in rate and delay centered on
					zero, with the grid spacing equal to 
					the Nyquist intervals.
			(iv)  all	This form is the same as rxd, except
					that the entire Nyquist range in
					each dimension is used
			(v)   srchpos	This is the same as form (i), except
					that the rate and delay offsets are
					taken from the input A-file
					specified in the -r option.  Use of
					this mode forces the -c flag.
			The multi-pass options are designed to be used in
			fringe-searching.  Segmentation is performed for
			all grid points, one pass per grid point.  Passes
			are separated on output by "*endofscan".

			The output data are rotated from the fourfit values of
			rate and multiband delay in accordance with the
			offsets, except in -c mode, when these offsets
			are relative to corel.

		-r afile
			The A-file format can be used to specify a dataset.
			The type-2 contents of the named afile must be scan
			based, and fringex will process each file pointed to
			by each A-file line.  No attempt is made to sort the
			afile before reading it, and if the contents are
			randomly ordered, some inefficiency may result due to
			the need to read root files multiple times.  Sorting
			of the afile by rootcode can be easily accomplished
			with aedit before invoking fringex -r



ARGUMENTS:	data file list
			This argument specifies the type-2 files
			to be segmented.  The format of the data
                        file specification is the standard one for all MkIV
                        software.  You may specify individual filenames,
                        scan directories which contain data files,
                        experiment directories, or any combination of
                        these three.  In the latter two cases, fringex
			will descend the directory tree looking for
                        data files to add to its internal list of files to
                        process.  Each file is processed sequentially,
			and the output is concatenated.  All option flags
			must precede the data file list.  If the -r flag is
			used, the data file list is ignored.

ENVIRONMENT:	None


DESCRIPTION:

Fringex is the program responsible for chopping the output data from 
fourfit into short, coherently averaged segments.  Its most important
job is to do this segmenting incorporating rate, delay and position
offsets supplied by the user, thereby discarding the full-scan
coherent fringe search solution found by fourfit, and permitting
the implementation of different fringe search algorithms based on
A-file data.  It is the starting point for the HOPS millimeter VLBI
suite of analysis programs.
