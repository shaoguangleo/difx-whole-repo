    <h1>Overview of the DiFX GUI</h1>
    The DiFX GUI was developed at the United State Naval Observatory as
    a front end to the DiFX software correlator.&nbsp; It was designed
    to minimize the effort required to conduct "normal" correlation
    tasks without crippling the flexibility sophisticated operators
    require for unique or unusual operations.&nbsp; While it was
    designed to make running the correlator easier, running the GUI (and
    reading this documentation) requires some understanding of DiFX and
    its components.<br>

    <h3><a name="WHAT_IT_DOES"></a>What the GUI Does<br>
    </h3>
    The USNO GUI serves two purposes:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">DiFX Cluster Monitor</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI monitors and displays the
      health and activity of DiFX cluster components (processors, Mark5
      units, etc) and shows the progress of DiFX jobs running on the
      cluster.&nbsp; In this capacity it is essentially a passive
      observer, serving as a somewhat more colorful replacement to the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">errormon</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">mk5mon</span> and <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cpumon</span> scripts that come with
      DiFX.<br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Experiment/Job Administrator</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI can also be used to create
      runnable jobs from "raw" data - scans and<span style="font-family:
        Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span> .vex file content.&nbsp;
      Files required to run DiFX and directories for data products are
      all created according to user specifications, and jobs are
      organized in "Experiments" and "Passes", all of which can be
      stored using a database.&nbsp; The GUI can then instruct DiFX to
      process these jobs, and will then monitor their progress and data
      products in detail.<br>
    </p>
    The GUI can also be used to perform some of the maintenance tasks
    associated with software correlators.<br>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3><a name="WHERE_TO_FIND_IT"></a>Downloading and Installing the
      GUI<br>
    </h3>
    The DiFX GUI is part of the DiFX software tree, currently located in
    the sub-directory:<br>
    <pre><tt>	applications/gui</tt></pre>
    The Java archive (".jar") file used to run the GUI itself is in:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/gui/dist/gui.jar<br></pre>
    And the top-level of this documentation:<br>
    <pre>	applications/gui/doc/intro.html<br></pre>
    The guiServer application is also part of the DiFX software tree,
    in:<br>
    <pre>	application/guiServer<br></pre>
    Using DiFX build procedures (such as <a
      href="https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/HPC/UsnoDifxInstallation"><i>difxbuild</i></a>)
    will compile <i>guiServer</i> and install it and gui.jar file in
    the appropriate bin directories.&nbsp; The gui.jar file does not
    need compilation.<br>
    <h3><a name="RUNNING_THE_GUI"></a>Running the GUI</h3>
    There are two components to the DiFX GUI.&nbsp; A single instance of
    the application <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    runs on one of the processing nodes in the DiFX cluster&nbsp; (the
    processor running <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    is often referred to in the documentation as the "DiFX Host" or
    the&nbsp; "DiFX head node").&nbsp; <i>GuiServer </i>must by run by
    a user (not root for security reasons) that has read/write
    permissions over all data directories used by DiFX.&nbsp; This user
    must also be able to start processes on all other nodes using <span
      style="font-style: italic;">mpirun.</span>&nbsp; It probably makes
    most sense to have the user that you normally use to run DiFX from
    the command line run <i>guiServer</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <i>GuiServer</i> is run from the command line on the DiFX Host:<br>
    <pre>	guiServer [PORT #]
</pre>
    The optional port number is the TCP connection port used to
    communicate with the GUI.&nbsp; If it is not specified, <i>guiServer</i>
    will use a default port number (it uses the value given by the
    DIFX_MESSAGE_PORT environment variable, or 50200 if that is not
    available).&nbsp; As soon as it is started, <i>guiServer</i> will
    give a message indicating the port it is using:<br>
    <pre>	server at port 50200
</pre>
    The GUI itself is a Java program that can be run anywhere that a
    network connection to the DiFX cluster is available (not necessarily
    on the LAN of the DiFX cluster) on any platform that can run Java
    using its ".jar" file:<br>
    <pre>	java -jar gui.jar<br></pre>
    Once the GUI is running, the address of the DiFX Host (where <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> is running) and the
    port number (what <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    told you above) can be entered in the Settings menu to connect the
    two (see <a
href="file:///Users/johnspitzak/NetBeansProjects/doi/USNO/doc/settings_content.html#DiFX_Control_Connection">DiFX



      Control Connection</a> in the Settings documentation for
    details).&nbsp; A proper connection will be pretty obvious - the
    "guiServer Connection" light will turn green, a "connection
    successful" message will appear, and, assuming you have other items
    operating properly, the GUI should start displaying information
    about the components of the DiFX cluster.<br>
    <h3>&lt;IMAGE HERE&gt;<br>
    </h3>
    The GUI and <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> can
    be started in any order - the GUI will connect as soon as a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> becomes
    available.&nbsp; Any number of GUI sessions can be run
    simultaneously using the same <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>.<br>
