To add a new (simple) parameter, one must modify a number
of the sources.  The ones marked * are optional--depends
on what you're changing.

  1. control.h
    most likely the paraameter value needs to be kept in struct c_block

  2. parser.h
    most likely you'll need to provide a new token for the parameter

* 3. param_struct.h
    it depends on what you're doing

  4. init_tokens.c
    maps your tokens to the control file strings

  5. default_cblock.c
    set the default value

  6. nullify_cblock.c
    set to recognizible null value

  7. copy_cblock_parts.c
    a line to copy it when non-null

  8. parser.c
    appropriate fsm changes

* 9. create_fsm.c
    if your change also requires changes the fsm

* 10. implementation:
    precorrect.c -- if changes prior to fringe search
    ...

  11. ../../help/fourfit.doc
    document what the new parameter does

* 12. ../../data/ff_testdata/chk..sh
    consider adding a test to verify that what you changed
    does what you want (now and into the future).
