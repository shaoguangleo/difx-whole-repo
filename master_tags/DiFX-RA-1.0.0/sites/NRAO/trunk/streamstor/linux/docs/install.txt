      LINUX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STREAMSTOR SDK Version 9.2

NOTE: The installation must be performed as "root" since hardware device
drivers must be installed.  

Programs linked with a StreamStor SDK API (libssapi.a) from SDK releases 
prior to SDK 9.0 are not compatible with SDK 9.x.  To use SDK 9.x, you 
must recompile your programs with the new API.  You must also execute 
ssflash to flash the new SDK 9.x firmware your StreamStor (see below). 

1. Create a directory to hold the StreamStor files and sub-directories, 
   for example, /usr/local/streamstor.

2. Change directory to the installation directory, for example, 
   cd /usr/local/streamstor.

3. Extract the StreamStor files:
     tar xvzf /mnt/cdrom/linux/XXX.tgz (or other path if not CDROM)
   where XXX is the basename of the .tgz file (e.g., sslinux92.tgz).

4. The driver, windrvr6.o, is a kernel module. It must be recompiled for
   every kernel version on which it is loaded.  IMPORTANT:  In order to 
   recompile windrvr6, you must have the Linux kernel source installed 
   on your system.

   After you have ensured that the kernel source is installed, recompile 
   windrvr6.o. To do so, cd to the linux/driver/redist directory then 
   enter:

      ./configure --disable-usb-support
      chmod 755 setup_inst_dir
      chmod 755 wdreg
      make install

   ******************************************************************
   *  Note the above "--disable-usb-support" option for configure   *
   *  command.  This is new beginning with SDK 8.3.                 *
   ******************************************************************

   The shared library, libwdapi1031.so will be installed in /usr/lib.
   Your application code must link to this library.

   Note that the "configure" program will generate the driver makefile.
   You must run "configure" to create a new makefile and then rebuild 
   the driver whenever you upgrade your Linux operating system.

5. Follow instructions that are output by the install script to load the 
   driver module on startup and to set permissions on /dev/windrvr6. 
   Note that instructions for installing the WinDriver kernel module
   may change from release to release, so please be sure to read them.

6. Set the environment variable "STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH" to the location of
   the StreamStor local bib directory.  For example, if you have 
   installed the StreamStor files in /usr/local/streamstor/linux:

            STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH=/usr/local/streamstor/linux/bib
            export STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH

7. Run ssflash to upgrade the firmware, etc. on your system. Instructions 
   are below, in the section called "FLASH INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPGRADING." 

8. Run the utility program sstest to verify operation of the StreamStor.  
   Note that sstest will erase all StreamStor data.

   For compatibility with older versions of gcc, SDK 9.x has two versions 
   of the utility programs.  .../streamstor/linux/util contains programs 
   built with gcc 4.x.  .../streamstor/linux/lib/gcc_v3/util contains 
   programs built with gcc 3.x.  

9. The directory linux/example contains the source code for several 
   examples.  Examine the example.mk file in that directory and change 
   the STREAMSTOR path variable (if necessary) in the makefile to point 
   to the path where you have installed the StreamStor API.  Then, 
   "make" the example and run it to verify that the StreamStor library 
   and headers have been installed correctly.

10. SDK 9.x includes two versions of the StreamStor SDK library:
   
    - libssapi.a built with a 4.1.2 version of gcc (under linux/lib/gcc_v4) 
    - libssapi.a built with a 3.4.6 version of gcc (under linux/lib/gcc_v3)

   You will need to link your software to the appropriate version of 
   libssapi.a, depending on what version of gcc your system has installed and
   whether or not you have installed compatibility libraries (such as
   Fedora's compat-libstdc++-33-3.2.3-61.)

   To determine the version of gcc that your system has installed, enter:

            gcc -v
  
   Depending on your specific Linux distribution, you may need to link 
   your applications with the realtime library (i.e., "-lrt") to resolve 
   references to clock_gettime().


                        FLASH INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPGRADING

IMPORTANT:  As part of the upgrade process, firmware code may need to 
be flashed (rather than downloaded) onto your StreamStor boards.  The 
StreamStor utility function ssflash can be executed to flash boards that are 
"Generation 4" or newer.  (Boards that are older than Generation 4 
include the PXI-808, PCI-816XF2, PCI-816VXF2, and the PCI-V100.)

For Generation 4 or newer boards, when you install a new SDK, you should 
evaluate whether or not you want to upgrade the firmware on your boards 
with the versions provided in the new SDK.  If you choose to upgrade, 
then you must run ssflash.

If you run ssflash on your StreamStor boards, you may not be able to 
revert to older versions of flashed code unless you return your board 
to Conduant for re-flashing. Therefore, please make sure that you want 
to permanently upgrade your StreamStor boards prior to executing ssflash.

NEW for SDK 9.0:  To run ssflash to upgrade your system, follow these
instructions.  In the instructions below, <INSTALLDIR> refers to the 
directory where you extracted the StreamStor files.

   1. Set and export STREAMSTOR_BIB_PATH as described above.
   2. Change directory to the ssflash directory:
      For the gcc v4 version of ssflash:
         cd <INSTALLDIR>/util 
      For the gcc v3 version of ssflash:
         cd <INSTALLDIR>/lib/gcc_v3/util
   3. Execute ssflash, providing it the name of the upgrade file 
      (i.e., SDK9.2.ssf) and the "-u" option as follows, where 
      <StreamStor Index> is the index of the card to flash. 

      To execute the gcc v4 version of ssflash to upgrade a system:
         ./ssflash -i <StreamStor Index> -u SDK9.2.ssf
      To execute the gcc v3 version of ssflash to upgrade a system:
         ./ssflash -i <StreamStor Index> -u <INSTALLDIR>/util/SDK9.2.ssf

      For example:
         ./ssflash -i2 -u SDK9.2.ssf

      If your StreamStor system has only one StreamStor card, you 
      can omit the "-i <StreamStor Index>", since card index 1 is 
      flashed by default.
   4. Run ssflash for each StreamStor card you want to upgrade.
