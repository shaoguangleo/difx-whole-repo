Goal: all data from which difx schedules are derived come from VexTables

Exceptions: zoom bands, machines


Don't forget to:

* revisit clocks (especially poly model)

* copy VSNs, files -> Vex struct

* VexData no longer prints events.  Do this elsewhere.

* VDIF: nthread = 1 or set by ::::'s ;  nChanPerThread = nRecordChan / nThread

* datasource set for first time in apply...

* RECORD flag... how to handle?

* zoom bands are property of setup

* name mappings (sources, antennas, ...) as specified in v2d file end up in a renaming map

new equivalent for Scan.corrSetup


Operate rules from v2d onto vex structure
 - setups/modes and scans using them
 - sources and the scans they are in?
 - explicit scan names?

Datastream linked from Setup, not antenna

Data linked from Antenna (includes VSN)


figure out what do do with shelf


General program flow:

1. load/parse v2d file

2. load/parse
