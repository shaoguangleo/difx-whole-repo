COMMAND NAME:	twrite

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"twrite filename"

DESCRIPTION:

Writes all unflagged type 3 data in memory out to the filename
specified in the argument.  The data are written out
according to the current sort order (as determined by
execution of the "sort" command).  If the data are not
sorted, the output order is the same as the order in
which the data were read.  The output A-file format version
is controlled by the "outversion" command, and defualts to 
the same as that read in.

The input filters are ignored on "write".
The way to write out selected data is to set the input
filters and then run "edit inputs", before using "write".

To write out type 0, 1 or 2 data, use the "write" command.
