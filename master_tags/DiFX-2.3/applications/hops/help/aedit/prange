COMMAND NAME:	prange

TYPE:		Data selection

SYNTAX:		e.g. "prange 2 >4.6"
		or "prange 17 <1.5e-12"
		or "prange 1 -25 74"

DESCRIPTION:

This command sets the input filter for a selected extracted parameter.  The
parameter is identified by the first argument, which is the identification tag
of the parameter reported by the "plist" command.  It is thus not easy to run
"prange" without first executing "plist".  Neither of these commands work,
obviously, unless you have already extracted some parameters with the
"parameter" command.

The parameter data range of this filter can be specified either with an inequality
(no >= or <= because all parameters are floating point quantities internally),
or two numerical values, a lower and then an upper limit.  To exclude a finite
range of values, you must merge two input files, each of which has had one of
the inequality limits applied.  This limitation will be removed in due course.
Thus, the above examples will pass, respectively:

All scans with values of extracted parameter 2 greater than 4.6

All scans with values of extracted parameter 17 less than 1.5e-12

All scans with values of extracted parameter 1 between -25.0 and +74.0

In the same manner as all filter settings in aedit, the data flagging occurs only
upon invocation of the "edit inputs" command.  In the case of extracted
parameters, the filtering during a read operation which normally occurs is
suppressed.
