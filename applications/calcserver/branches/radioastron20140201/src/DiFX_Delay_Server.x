                               of the target source.  For altaz mounts,

                               angle is the same as the parallactic angle,
                               and is positive for positive hour
                               angles.  For equatorial mounts, the

                               is zero.  For other mount types, and for
                               target sources away from the pointing
                               direction, the values may be different.
                               The mount-source angle is important for
