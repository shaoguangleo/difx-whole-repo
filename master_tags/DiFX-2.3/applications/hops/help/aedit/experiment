COMMAND NAME:	experiment

TYPE:		Data selection

SYNTAX:		"experiment 1953"

DESCRIPTION:

Sets the experiment input data selection parameter.  Only one
experiment number may be specified at one time.  Scans which do
not belong to the specified experiment number will not pass the
filters applied by edit inputs, read, and plot.  Typing "experiment"
without arguments removes any restriction on experiment number.
