COMMAND NAME:	setyear

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"setyear 1989"

DESCRIPTION:

This command is present only to allow the user to circumvent an
unfortunate problem with the A-file format.  Some A-files have
the year of the scan in field 7, but in others this information
is replaced by the number of the parent type-51 HP-1000 extent.
Generally, aedit will recognize the latter type of A-file on
read, and notify the user that the scan year information is
missing from some of the data.  In such cases, the year is set
to 1980.  The recommended course of action is for the user to
set the timerange to the offending span in 1980 with all other
filters wide open, run "edit inputs" to flag all good data,
force the year to the correct value with "setyear", and unflag
the good data again.  If all data is actually from the same
calendar year, the edit and unflag steps are unnecessary - you
can run setyear on the whole dataset.

Confusing things could happen if the parent extent number exceeds
80, but this should be almost never.

This command should become obsolete as the move to UNIX proceeds.
