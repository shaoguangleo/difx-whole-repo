COMMAND NAME:	run

TYPE:		action

SYNTAX:		"run filename"

DESCRIPTION:

Causes the aedit commands in "filename" to be executed, just
as if they were typed at the terminal.  For obvious reasons,
there are a couple of exceptions.  Confirmation is no longer
requested when using run files, and certain interactive
operations (edit cursor, zoom) are disabled.  Aedit command
files can be nested up to a depth of 10.  Any error within
a run file causes the execution to abort, and control returns
to the terminal, regardless of how deeply the runfiles are
nested.

Comments can be inserted in aedit runfiles by placing an
asterisk character in the first column of the comment line.
