COMMAND NAME:	fplot

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"fplot" (no arguments)

DESCRIPTION:

Enables the cursor on an active plot on an interactive
graphics device.  The user selects a point by positioning
the cursor and typing any character except 'x' or 'X', and 
the program pops up a fringe plot on the screen.  

For Mk3: This fringe plot can be dismissed with the 'q' key, 
and the cursor is then ready for the next point.

For Mk4: By default, the fringe plot pops into a passive
ghostscript window, which is persistent, and the pgplot
cursor is ready for the next point.  The plot cannot be
printed or saved.  If the character 'b' or 'B' is typed,
however, control passes to the terminal window in which aedit
is being run, and hardcopy or file save can be selected
with 'h' or 's'.  Control returns to the pgplot window upon
receipt of any other keystroke in the terminal window.

Note that the "fplot" command works only in an X-windows
environment.  Also, to display a fringe plot, aedit must be
able to locate the type-2 (fringe) file on disk from which the
A-file data were generated.  By default, it looks in the
CORDATA area, but if the DATADIR environment variable is set,
it looks there instead.

"Fplot" is terminated by typing an 'x' or 'X'.
