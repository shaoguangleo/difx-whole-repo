Version 3.6.0
* SU table: make more IDI-FITS compliant
* AG table: fill in antenna diameters, or 0 if not known.
  - values used in difxio: difxio/antenna_db.c

Version 3.5.0
* Remove duplicate RDATE keywords from AG and ML tables
* With changes in difxio, ensure same-day EOPs are equal before merging jobs
* Make use of EOP merging mode concept.  See changelog in difxio.
* Slight restructuring if difx2fits.c: load all filesets at beginning; no need to keep reloading them
* plotpcal2 : second attempt to plot pcals in a more general way.  Still not super satisfactory.
* Fix a case where absence of pulse cal file leads to seg fault (NRAO bug VLB-134, second part)
* Fix a long-standing (introduced in 2009 for DiFX-2.0) problem in generating the MC table:  The last term in the clock polynomial (ususally the rate) was ignored, causing incorrect entries in both the clock (due to drift since the reference time) and clock rate columns of this table.
* Support multiple datastreams per antenna.  Only changes really needed were in handling of DiFX-extracted pulse cal.
* Lynn Matthews reported a problem with AN tables when performing VBGLU.  Problem was found to be populating POLCALA and POLCALB arrays witn NOPCAL=0, causing confusion in AIPS.  Fixed.
* Fix jobmatrix output when subneting and/or given difx files not in time order
* Adding support for taking union of frequency setups; depends on incomplete implementation in difxio
* Don't raise a warning for a normal case where the sniffer buffer can be breached by one element.  Just ignore it and move on.
* Support frequency setup merging using the --union option
* Support building FITS files for profile mode correlations
  (autocorrelations included for bins > 0)
* Check polarizations for legality before proceeding (and segfaulting)
* Fix for cablecal files when reported measurement duration is zero
* In pulse cal table, set unused entries to NaNs to confirm to IDI-FITS standard
* Version for DiFX-2.5, May 16, 2017

Version 3.4.0
* Add command line option --primary-band.  This causes a keyword to be added to the output FITS file.  Intended for VLITE.
* makefits: check for files being multiple of 2880 bytes
* fixes in pulse cal handling: better logic in closing files, some improvements in code clarity and some minor performance improvements.
  - this fixes a bad bug when number of jobs is large; max number of file descriptors got exceeded.
* print MJD range of converted output
* add utility plotpcal
* update pulse cal: Use new, more natural format for .difx/PCAL* files made by mpifxcorr
* allow addition of history though external file (--history option)
* add DELTAT keyword to ModelComps table.  Required for != 2 minute polynomial intervals
* Tsys: replace 999 with NaN for one case of invalid Tsys
* Version for DiFX-2.4, Nov 4, 2014

Version 3.3.0
* Improved clarity in generation of Flag, Tsys, Pcal, Gain and Weather tables: prioritized sources of data
* Fix off-by-one timestamp error in the sniffer output files
* All times are UTC (always have been).  Change variables and comments to reflect this and avoid some confusion.
* Add utility to show which sources of calibration data (GN, PH, FG, WX, TS) will be used by difx2fits (called showcal)
* Version for DiFX-2.3, Dec 20, 2013

Version 3.2.0
* Fix for correlation of mismatched sidebands.  Requires contemporaneous
upgrade of difxio.
* Add DIFX_LABEL env var to FITS files
* Make sniffer plots more consistent with AIPS.  They will always show USB now and should have the same phase sense.
* Use the SX gain table rows when SX observing is used.  Thanks to James Miller-Jones for reporting the problem.
* pcal, weather, tsys, and flag files could be compromized by observations spanning the new year.
  - Now handle day of year jumps
  - Also handle possible use of mjds rather than days of year in future
* increase number of phase cal tones allowed
* Version for DiFX-2.2, 31 May 2013

Version 3.1.0
* Version renumber from 3.0.2 prior to DiFX-2.1 release
* Version for DiFX-2.1, 4 May 2012

Version 3.0.2
* Post DiFX-2.0.1
* Improved reporting when weights go crazy (negative)
* --zero (or -0) option: don't write visibilities (well, write one per input file)
  - not useful for AIPS as AIPS requires a UV table
* makefits: pass along non-dashed options to difx2fits
* Do better job verifying baseband data files have compliant names.
* Improved checking on fopen return values
* Maximum number of file descriptors checked.  For large merges this can be a problem.
* Multiple DIFX files per job: don't write records from later files that overlap in time with those written by earlier ones.
  - perhaps later the order of things should change and the _newer_ records get kept.
  - multiple SWITCHEDPOWER and PCAL files are handled in the same way
* Make use of new difx_tcal infrastructure
* Support DiFX job restarts
* Better support for mixed 1 and 2 bit data: include antenna-based numbers in FITS and scale accordingly
* Populate the new RAOBS and DECOBS (pointing center) columns of the source table

Version 3.0.1
* Post 2.0.0
* Make use of clock shifting function in difxio

* don't invoke sniffer in cases where it would use too much memory
* don't overwrite FITS when parse-all input difx are from different vex setups (thanks Jan Wagner)
