COMMAND NAME:	close

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		close [force]

DESCRIPTION:

Causes all type 2 baseline data in memory to be examined, and 
closure triangles to be formed.  The result is a set of type-3 
records in memory, which can then be plotted, edited, filtered 
and written out to disk just like other data.  The close command 
will refuse to generate closure data unless there are currently 
no triangle records present.

Normally, mismatching epochs and reference frequencies will cause
aedit to refuse to compute a triangle record.  Under some
circumstances, all that is needed is a list of triangles, not
valid closure quantities.  The optional "force" argument overrides
the epoch and frequency checking to permit such list generation.
This option should be used only with knowledge and caution.
