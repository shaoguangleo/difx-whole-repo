STEPS TO INSTALL THE POLCONVERT PACKAGE:

0.  Install required linux packages if not already present
    (cfitsio is in the EPEL repo):

    yum install python-devel
    yum install cfitsio cfitsio-devel
    yum install java

1.- Compile the C++ module. Just run:

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    
    After this step, the file "_PolConvert.so" should have 
    been created.  You may need to manually edit setup.py
    to provide include locations for, e.g. fitsio.h and
    possibly a link directive for libcfitsio.

2.- Copy all the files of this directory into a destination directory. 
    The name of the destination directory could be, e.g.

         /YourHomeDir/.casa/Nordic_Tools

3.- Go to that directory and execute the "buildmytasks" command.

4.- Edit the file "YourHomeDirectory/.casa/init.py" and add the line
    (create it if it doesn not already exist):

    execfile("YourHomeDirectory/.casa/Nordic_Tools/mytasks.py")

5.- The task should now be available. Just start CASA and write:

               tget polconvert

    to load the task.
 
6.- To restore to the distributed state:

    rm -rf build _PolConvert.so *.pyc
    rm -rf polconvert.py polconvert_cli.py mytasks.py

Any feedback and bug report should be sent either to the ARC 
Nordic Node (contact@nordic-alma.se) or to the source maintainer
(ivan.marti-vidal@chalmers.se).


P.S: The QA2 directory contains scripts for the proper calibration
of the ALMA measurement sets. Specifically, the script 
"scriptForCalibrationAPP.py" shall be run for generating the 
calibration tables to apply PolConvert.
