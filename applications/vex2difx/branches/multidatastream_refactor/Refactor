Goal: all data from which difx schedules are derived come from VexTables

Exceptions: zoom bands, machines


Urgent:

Eventually:

* RECORD flag... how to handle?
  - Handled OK for now.  Eventually maybe RECORD flags should be done per datastream???

* zoom bands are property of corrparams
  - OK for now.  Eventually migrate to VexSetup

* name mappings (sources, antennas, ...) as specified in v2d file end up in a renaming map

* move all relevant functionality into applyCorrParams()
  - clocks
  - zoom
  - correlator parameters

* restore decimation / oversampling?

* dead code removal from JobGroup::genEvents


Test status:

bd178e1: (Module swaps, pulsar)

dq522:  (Many modes)
  some antenna coords differ in their last digit
  flag: flag file is empty	 (maybe OK, because new vex2difx excluded the antenna)

td091a:  
  some antenna coords differ in their last digit

rv111:   (VDIF, Mark4)

bf115q:  (Mark5B)
  slight differences in antenna coords
  slight differences in flag file

ts036h:  (Files)

To test:

* clock offsets
* LO offsets
* polarization swap
... * various ways to specify VDIF format
x   * test multi-thread multi-channel VDIF simply by specifying fewer threads than record chans
* multi-phase-center
x   * file-based

Operate rules from v2d onto vex structure
 - setups/modes and scans using them
 - sources and the scans they are in?
 - explicit scan names?
