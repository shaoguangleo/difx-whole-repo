Goal: all data from which difx schedules are derived come from VexTables

Exceptions: zoom bands, machines


Urgent:

Eventually:

* RECORD flag... how to handle?
  - Handled OK for now.  Eventually maybe RECORD flags should be done per datastream???

* zoom bands are property of corrparams
  - OK for now.  Eventually migrate to VexSetup

* name mappings (sources, antennas, ...) as specified in v2d file end up in a renaming map

* move all relevant functionality into applyCorrParams()
  - clocks
  - zoom
  - correlator parameters

* restore decimation / oversampling?

* dead code removal from JobGroup::genEvents


Test status:

bd178e1:

dq522:
  some antenna coords differ in their last digit
  flag: flag file is empty	 (maybe OK, because new vex2difx excluded the antenna)

td091a:
  some antenna coords differ in their last digit

rv111:

To test:

* shelves
* clock offsets
* LO offsets
* polarization swap
* various ways to specify VDIF format
* test multi-thread multi-channel VDIF simply by specifying fewer threads than record chans
* multi-phase-center

Operate rules from v2d onto vex structure
 - setups/modes and scans using them
 - sources and the scans they are in?
 - explicit scan names?
