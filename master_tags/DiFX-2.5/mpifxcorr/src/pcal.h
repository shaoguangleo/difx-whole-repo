 * Multi-tone Phase Cal Extraction
 *
 * @brief Extracts and integrates multi-tone phase calibration signal information from an input signal.
 *
 * The extractor factory chooses one out of three currently available methods for signal extraction.
 * The choice depends on the parameters which are:
 *   spacing: frequency step between one tone and the next
 *   offset:  frequency offset between the first tone and the band start at 0 Hz
 *            note that the first tone can be at DC; processing will discard it
 *
 * Spacing is assumed to be constant throughout the band.
 * A tone spacing is "integer" if it divides the sampling rate evenly
 * with a "small" value for the quotient.
 *
 * Basic extractor:
 *   When tone spacing is "integer" and offset is zero, i.e. tones start
 *   from DC and are at multiples of the spacing, then the extraction of
 *   amplitude and phase information is quite easy.
 *
 *   The input sample sequence can be segmented into N-length pieces according to
 *   the period (in N samples) of the lowest tone frequency. A r2c FFT of the time
 *   integrated segments gives the amplitude and phase of every tone. The 0th bin
 *   contains a tone but carries no phase information and is discarded.
 *
 * Shifting extractor:
 *   When the offset is non-zero, the signal can be counter-rotated with a
 *   precomputed complex sine to restore the offset back to zero. The basic
 *   extractor is then applied.
 *   After time integration a c2c FFT gives the amplitude and phase of every tone.
 *   In this case the 0th bin contains meaningful phase info of the first shifted tone.
 *
 * Implicit shifting extractor:
 *   Another method when the offset frequency is non-zero can be used.
 *   The offset frequency should have a period M=gcd(fs,foffset) which is "small"
 *   and which divides the sampling rate evenly. The signal is then split into M-sized
 *   segments for time integration. A final r2c FFT returns an extended spectrum.
 *   Only certain bins of this spectrum contain the tones.
 *   These bins are gathered together for the final output values.
 *
 * All extractors return amplitude and phase of the tones.
 *
 * The output data could also be analyzed in the time domain where the relative,
 * average instrumental delay can be found directly by estimating the position
 * of the peak in the time-domain data.
