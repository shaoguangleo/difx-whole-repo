This directory contains various standalone programs that
have proven useful in manipulating mk5a, mk5b, and vdif files.

Each program is built by executing the build script, which is
typically a one-liner invoking gcc. As they say, no warranties,
expressed or implied.

a2b           makea2b copies mk5a to mk5b files, for a few common formats
b2a           makeb2a copies a mk5b file to a mk5a file
b2vdif        makeb2v copies a mk5b file to a vdif format file
bchan_reorder makebcr allows low-level modifications of a mk5b file
bnoise32      makebn32 creates 2 mk5b files with a specified amount of
                       purely white correlated noise
bpcal         makebp   extracts phase cal from a mk5b file
