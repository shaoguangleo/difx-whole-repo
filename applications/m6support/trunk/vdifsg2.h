 * This file provides support for the fuse interface.
 * This version is rather primitive in many respects.
 *
 * This file provides glue to the sg_access library
 * in order to support random access read to sgv2 fragments
 * which when combined form the complete vdif sequence.

/*
 * We maintain a working "stripe" of SGv2 blocks, sorted by
 * packet times across all the files of the sequence.  Typically,
 * the stripe contains as many (numb) as there are members of the
 * sequence (ffi->numb), but if a member ends early, the "zero"
 * will be advanced and the working stripe will contain one or
 * more fewer members.  Likewise, if there is a gap (because the
 * next block is in the same member as the stripe), we may have
 * a stripe containing fewer valid members with a gap at "sgap".
 *
 * The read byte offset (ffi->offset) should then lie within the
 * "zero" element of the stripe and proceed through the packets of
 * that block up to "sgap".  The major support functions include:
 *
 * member_show(sfp, ith)     diagnostic on ith member (fragment)
 * member_show(sfp, ith)     tracing variant (one-liner)
 * member_move(sfp,blk,dir)  move this member to a new block
 * member_init(sfp)          initialize one member (fragment)
 * 
 * stripe_trace(sdp, l, a)   tracing variant (multiline version) of
 * stripe_show(sdp, l, a)    diagnostic on the stripe
 * stripe_comp(a, b)         comparison function for sorting
 * stripe_sort(sdp)          sort the members of the sequence
 * stripe_schk(sdp)          check the sort of the sequence
 * stripe_zero(sdp)          find the new stripe "zero"
 * stripe_dgap(sdp)          adjust the stripe to remove gaps
 * stripe_boff(sdp)          compute the byte offset in sieqence
 * stripe_init(sdp, f)       initializes the stripe at start
 * stripe_vern(sdp, b)       vernier bw walk into the bytes needed
 *
 * stripe_find(sdp)          used when "offset" is outside stripe
 * stripe_walk(sdp, dir)     used when stripe shifts incrementally
 * stripe_chck(sdp)          used to decide strategy on stripe access
 * stripe_anal(sdp)          double-check preceding check
 *
 * stripe_read(sdp, buf, l)  loads bytes into buffer from existing stripe
 * stripe_rdfw(sdp, buf)     read forwards from existing stripe
 * stripe_rdbw(sdp, buf)     read backwards from existing stripe
 *
 * "zero" is managed in the walking/finding
 * "sgap" is managed in the degapping
 * A move will never move past the last block or the first one.
 *
 * Note that packets may be smaller than their read_size, and
 * there are headers in the file, so certain calculations must
 * respect this, but the bytes and sizes for tracking the fuse
 * read() bytes are within the virtual file (i.e. just packets).
 *
 * Errors are tracked on a per-member basis.
 *
 * Frame count is limited to 16777216 so times can be easily handled
 * as seconds + 1e-8*frames (PKTDT); we assume a common epoch, since
 * it is illegal for this to change during an observation.
 * (Note that some noise is introduced by this math.)  A pseudo-time
 * is generated in packet_time() which steps over invalid frames at
 * either end of the block.
