- Add interface to allow a user-provided alternate Mark6 disk array
  mount point; the current Mark6 "standard" mount points /mnt/disks/[1-4]/[0-7]/ 
  are assumed for now...

- Add more thorough checks to input file quality (check magic word,
  check that all file headers indicate the same packet size and block size,
  etc)
