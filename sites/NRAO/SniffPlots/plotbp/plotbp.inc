C     BPDAT split in efforts to understand some size issues - July 2009
C     Putting the COMMON for BPDAT after the other 2 seems to have 
C     fixed the problem.  g77 bug?
C     Running into problems with "relocation truncated to fit" errors
C     when I tried to increase the number of channels in Mar. 2013.  
C     The problem can crop up even with the tiny (one integer) common
C     in VLBOPE.  I sense that all the commons are getting lumped 
C     together.  Some GOOGLE work indicates that this is simply because 
C     of wanting too much memory (>2GB?) and it is a linker issue.  
C     They suggest compiling with -mcmodel=medium  (gcc option).  
C     That looks like it might work, but libcit will also need it. 
C     that risks having other programs compiled without it break.
C     I have to back off the space in the commons.

C     Variables for reading lines of data.  Put in common to
C     avoid compiler complaints about unused variables.

C     Keep summary.  Note MSTA refers to station pairs and can be
C     larger than the number of stations if a joint data set from 
C     more than one sniff is used.  But it won't likely be the number
C     of baselines total.  A typical global situation is that two
C     antennas are used for reference - one European and one US.  For
C     20 station observations, there would then be 2*19 pairs.  Try
C     that for a while.  Note the 3D arrays.  They can get big fast
C     if not careful.  With MCHAN=32768, MSTA=40, MFR=80 are near
C     the limit.  Small increases in either overflow the memory the
C     compiler can handle.
