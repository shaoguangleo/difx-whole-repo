COMMAND NAME:	psplot

TYPE:		Experiment summary

SYNTAX:		"psplot"

DESCRIPTION:

This command takes the data in memory plus the image of a cc file in memory
and constructs a 2-D array of quality codes.  This is then displayed
in an Xwindow PGPLOT window as a (possibly multi-page) colour-coded
matrix.  Interactive cursor operations are then invoked for data
perusal, editing, and fringe plot popups.

The on-screen buttons are self-explanatory.  In general, the left mouse
button either tags or pops up fringe plots (depending on the setting
of the on-screen buttons), while the middle button prints cell identification
information in the lower left corner of the window.  The right button
immediately zaps the data point from the database.  Tagged cells are
indicated by a small white triangle in the center of the cell.  The
keystrokes 'a', 'f' and 'x' cause tagging, fringe plot popup, and
immediate zapping respectively, regardless of the setting of the on-screen
buttons.  You can tag many cells at once.  To tag an entire baseline,
click on the baseline label.  To tag an entire scan, click on the scan
label.  To tag all cells with a particular quality code, click on the
quality code key at the bottom of the window.  All tagging is done on
a toggle basis (i.e. do it again and the tag disappears).  Upon exit of
psplot, you can zap, write out to disk, or ignore the list of tagged
records.
