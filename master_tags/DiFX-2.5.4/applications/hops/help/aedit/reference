COMMAND NAME:	reference

TYPE:		Plot control

SYNTAX:		"reference"

DESCRIPTION:

When a station-based quantity, like elevation, is plotted against a
baseline-based quantity, like SNR, either the reference or remote
elevation must be used.  This command specifies that it should be
the reference quantity which gets plotted, which is the startup
default.  There is a corresponding "remote" command.
