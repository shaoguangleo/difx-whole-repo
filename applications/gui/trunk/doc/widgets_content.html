    <h1>Standard Widgets and How They Behave<br>
    </h1>
    The DiFX GUI uses a number of purpose-built widgets to accomplish
    things that the Java Swing toolkit (which was inadvisedly chosen as
    the base for the GUI) did not include.&nbsp; These widgets are used
    throughout the GUI.&nbsp; While they were developed with the idea
    that their operation would be intuitive, this may not always be the
    case.&nbsp; For this reason they are described in some detail here.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Hierarchical_Indexed_Panels">Hierarchical "Indexed"
          Panels</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Smart_Text_Fields">"Smart" Text Fields</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Number_Boxes">Number Boxes</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Complex_Tooltips">Complex Tooltips</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Message_Windows_">Message Windows</a><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Hierarchical_Indexed_Panels"></a>Hierarchical "Indexed"
      Panels</h2>
    <p>Several of the windows that make up the GUI (most notably the <a
        href="experimentEditor.html">Experiment Editor</a> and <a
        href="Job_Control.html">Job Control Window</a>, but there are
      others) are organized in a browser form, with a small number of
      "top level" panels that can be opened or closed based on whether
      you are interested in them or not (some of these panels also
      contain their own, similar browser structures).&nbsp; To open or
      close a panel, click on the "title" bar at the top of the
      panel.&nbsp; If you open many panels you can often expand in size
      beyond the window limits, in which case the scroll bar on the
      right may be used to navigate up and down (the mouse wheel tries
      to do the same thing, as well as dragging the screen up and down
      with the mouse, although sometimes the panels trap these events
      for other purposes - the scroll bar will <span style="font-style:
        italic;">always</span> work).&nbsp; Arrows, as well as panel
      appearance will let you know whether they are "open" or
      "closed".&nbsp; Mixed in with the opening/closing panels are
      "permanent" panels that cannot be closed.&nbsp; Permanent panels
      do not have an obvious title bar and have no arrow icon.&nbsp; The
      example below (part of the Experiment Editor) shows open, closed,
      and permanent panels.&nbsp; The open panel "Sources" contains a
      series of closed panels.&nbsp; The bottom-most panel is
      "permanent".<br>

    <h2><a name="Smart_Text_Fields"></a>"Smart" Text Fields</h2>
    <p>The DiFX GUI has a number of "Text Field" widgets that allow the
      user to enter text (file paths, string settings, etc.).&nbsp;
      Except in a few cases, the settings you enter <b><i>do not </i></b>take


      effect until you hit the "enter" key.&nbsp; To indicate that a
      setting has been "changed" but not "committed" by hitting the
      enter key, the text fields will turn yellow once the text inside
      them is changed in any way.&nbsp; Hitting enter will both cause
      their content to be used and the yellow color to disappear.</p>
    <p align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/widgets/normalTextField.png" height="34" width="324"><br>
      <b>Unchanged Text Field</b><br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/widgets/changedTextField.png" height="31"
        width="323"><br>
      <b>Changed (Uncommitted) Text Field</b><br>
    </div>
    <h6>Tab Completion</h6>
    <p>In locations where text fields are specifying paths on the DiFX
      host, tab completion is implemented.&nbsp; Hitting the "tab" key
      will cause a remote "ls" operation on the DiFX host, the results
      of which will be used to extend the text field content as much as
      possible.&nbsp; This should act exactly like familiar tab
      completion except there may be a perceptible delay involved if the
      connection to the DiFX host through <i>guiServer</i> is
      slow.&nbsp; Tab completion does not work if you are not connected
      to the DiFX host through <i>guiServer</i>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Number_Boxes"></a>Number Boxes</h2>
    <p>Number boxes are Text Field widgets that are restricted to
      numbers.&nbsp; Their values can be changed either by typing (only
      numeric values are accepted), or by spinning the mouse over
      them.&nbsp; They can contain floating point or integer-only values
      - single clicks will increment/decrement one of the digits (chosen
      by the developer - hopefully appropriately).<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Complex_Tooltips"></a>Complex Tooltips</h2>
    <p>Tooltips are pop-up informational windows that appear when
      hovering over GUI widgets.&nbsp; Standard Java tooltips are
      restricted to single lines of text that have no formatting
      capacity, limiting the information that they can convey.&nbsp; The
      DiFX GUI has its own "Complex" tooltips that include multiple
      lines of text, different fonts, colors, and links to GUI
      documentation (they also have a better default background
      color).&nbsp; While it could be argued that they occasionally try
      to do too much, we feel they are more useful.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/widgets/java_tooltip.png" height="89" width="425"><br>
      <br>
      <b>Java Tooltip<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </b></div>
    <div align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/widgets/complex_tooltip.png" height="176"
        width="434"><br>
      <br>
      <b>Complex Tooltip</b><br>
    </div>
    <p>All Java-style tooltips throughout the GUI are gradually being
      replaced with Complex Tooltips.&nbsp; This is an on-going process.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="Message_Windows_"></a>Message Windows<br>
    </h2>
    The DiFX GUI provides a number of "message" windows that contain
    notifications from the GUI itself or from DiFX processes.&nbsp;
    Messages come in the typical three flavors:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Information</b> messages that draw attention to activities
        that may help monitor the progress of processing or have other
        value, but which require no action on the part of the
        user.&nbsp; Information messages are rendered with white text.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Warning</b> messages indicate the detection of a possible
        problem, but one that does not stop processing, or occasionally
        draw attention to "major" processing steps (such as the
        triggering of a DiFX process).&nbsp; The are shown in yellow
        text.</li>
      <li><b>Error</b> messages usually indicate a fatal problem that
        has, or is likely to stop processing.&nbsp; They are colored
        red.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
