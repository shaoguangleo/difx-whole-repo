# Python ctypes bindings for VDIFIO

# To re-build Python bindings from the C header files you
# need the ctypes and ctypeslib packages from Debian Squeeze (on Mark6): 
#
# A patch is likely needed for ctypeslib sub module codegenerator.py,
# see the difx mark5access library python directory for the patch.
#
# If ctypeslib is not available a pre-built (possibly out of sync)
# set of Python bindings is used instead.

aptitude install python-ctypes python-ctypeslib

python setup.py build
python setup.py install
