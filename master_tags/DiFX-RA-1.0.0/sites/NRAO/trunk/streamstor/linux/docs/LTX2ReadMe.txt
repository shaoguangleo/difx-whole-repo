LTX2

Start by running the setup application in the enclosed CD. This will install the StreamStor software on your system. 

Please look in the StreamStor\LTX2_Product_Support directory for LTX2 manuals and special support files used for
the LTX2 product. There is an example application in the \examples directory called SFPDPNetOpenExample.c which 
shows how to send commands to the LTX2 over the ethernet port while recording over the SFPDP port(s).
