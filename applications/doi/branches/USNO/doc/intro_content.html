    <h1>Overview of the DiFX GUI</h1>
    This is supposed to be an introduction to the USNO DiFX GUI.
    Eventually something well-written and introductory will be put here.<br>
    <h3>What the GUI Does<br>
    </h3>
    The USNO GUI serves two purposes:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">DiFX Cluster Monitor</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI monitors and displays the
      health and activity of DiFX cluster components (processors, Mark5
      units, etc) and shows the progress of DiFX jobs running on the
      cluster.&nbsp; In this capacity it is essentially a passive
      observer, serving as a somewhat more colorful replacement to the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">errormon</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">mk5mon</span> and <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cpumon</span> scripts that come with
      DiFX.<br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Experiment/Job Administrator</h5>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The GUI can also be used to create
      runnable jobs from "raw" data - scans and<span style="font-family:
        Courier New,Courier,monospace;"></span> vex file content.&nbsp;
      Files required to run DiFX and directories for data products are
      all created according to user specifications, and jobs are
      organized in "Experiments" and "Passes", all of which can be
      stored using a database.&nbsp; These jobs can then be run through
      DiFX and their progress and data products can be monitored in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Running the GUI</h3>
    There are two components to the DiFX GUI.&nbsp; A single instance of
    the application <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    runs on one of the processing nodes in the DiFX cluster.&nbsp; The
    processor running <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    is often referred to in the documentation as the "DiFX Host" node or
    "DiFX Control" node.&nbsp; Itshould have read and write permission
    over all data directories used by DiFX and must be able to start
    processes on all other nodes using <span style="font-style:
      italic;">mpirun</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The GUI itself is a Java program, currently called <span
      style="font-style: italic;">DiFXUIs</span> (this name is
    historical and will hopefully be changed some day).&nbsp; It can be
    run anywhere that a network connection to the DiFX cluster is
    available (not necessarily on the LAN of the DiFX cluster) on any
    platform that can run Java.&nbsp; Any number of GUI sessions can be
    run simultaneously using the same <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The GUI and <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> can
    be started in any order - the GUI will connect as soon as a <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> becomes available.<br>
    <br>
    GuiServer is run from the command line on the DiFX Host:<br>
    <pre>	guiServer [PORT #]
</pre>
    The optional port number is the TCP connection port.&nbsp; If it is
    not specified, guiServer will use a default port number (it uses the
    value given by the DIFX_MESSAGE_PORT environment variable, or 50200
    if that is not available).&nbsp; As soon as it is started, guiServer
    will give a message indicating the port it is using:<br>
    <pre>	server at port 50200
</pre>
    The GUI is run from its ".jar" file:<br>
    <pre>	java -jar DiFXUIs.jar
</pre>
    Once the GUI is running, the address of the DiFX Host (where <span
      style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span> is running) and the
    port number (what <span style="font-style: italic;">guiServer</span>
    told you above) can be entered to connect the two.&nbsp; See <a
      href="settings_content.html#DiFX_Control_Connection">DiFX Control
      Connection</a> in the Settings documentation for details.<br>
