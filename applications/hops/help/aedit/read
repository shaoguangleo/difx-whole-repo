COMMAND NAME:	read

TYPE:		Action

SYNTAX:		"read filename"

DESCRIPTION:

Reads data in from the filename specified in the argument.
If enough fields on the line are successfully decoded to 
identify the parent data file, a data entry is made in memory.  
If not even enough could be decoded to id the file, the line 
is skipped.  You can read as many files into aedit, one after 
the other, as you like.  "Read" filters the incoming data 
according to the data selection input parameters.

The unlimited data capacity of aedit is achieved by using
dynamic memory allocation inside the "read" function.  As
more memory is needed, the program obtains it from the system.
This memory is released by the command "clear data", or
by "exit".  The user is informed of memory usage during the
reading operation.
