COMMAND NAME:	outversion

TYPE:		IO control

SYNTAX:		"outversion n", where n is an integer

DESCRIPTION:

This allows the user to override the output format of the A-file when
the write command is used.  Currently, only versions 1 and 2 are
supported.  If you specify version 0 (the default), each line will
be written individually with the same format as that in which it
originated.

Note that writing data out in a different format version number from
the one it originated in will generate fields with undefined values
in the output.  Generally speaking, undefined strings are set to "???",
and undefined numerical quantities are set to zero.
