//!  Called in response to a user request to stop a DiFX job.  Jobs are uniquely
//!  identified by input file, which also, conveniently, is part of the command
//!  to mpirun that STARTED the job.  To stop the specific job, we effectively do
//!  a "ps" searching for "mpi" and parse out the PIDs of any line that contains 
//!  the input file name.  This should kill everything associated with the job.
//!
//!  This is a "set and forget" command.  There is no dynamic feedback.  However
//!  messages are sent using the standard DiFX message system.
