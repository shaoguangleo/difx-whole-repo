    The GUI provides a real-time monitoring capability that allows DiFX
    output to be viewed as a job is running.&nbsp; Plots of amplitude,
    phase, and delay are generated, and at the moment I'm not certain
    what good they are.&nbsp; But they're pretty anyway.&nbsp; Good for
    demos to impress relatives or uninformed visitors.<br>

    <h3><a name="Running_a_Job_to_Allow_Real-Time"></a>Running a Job to
      Allow Real-Time Monitoring</h3>
    <p>For real-time monitoring to work on a running job, it must be
      started with real-time monitoring enabled.&nbsp; This is done by
      checking the "Run With Monitor" check box on the <a href="Job_Control_content.html">Run Controls</a> panel in the <a href="Job_Controls_content.html">Job Control Window</a>:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/run_with_monitor.png" height="176" width="805"><br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div align="left">Checking this setting does not start real-time
      monitoring, it only triggers the hooks that allow it.&nbsp; In the
      background what it is doing is triggering <i>guiServer</i> to
      start <i>mpirun</i> with the "-M" option enabled (the details of
      this are described in the DiFX documentation <a href="http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/difx_monitor">here</a>).&nbsp;
      This permits the <i>monitor_server</i> process to then be able to
      access the products of the running job.&nbsp; The <i>monitor_server</i>
      process will also be started, if it is not already running.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    By default this setting is checked.&nbsp; It can safely be left
    checked even if you are not planning to run real-time monitoring
    with a DiFX job as it represents very little overhead.<br>
    <h3><a name="Starting_the_Monitor_and_Connecting_to_a"></a>Starting
      the Monitor and Connecting to a Job</h3>
    <p>The Job Monitor is controlled and monitor data are displayed
      through the Job Monitor Window.&nbsp; Each instance of this window
      is assigned to a single job.&nbsp; There are two ways to start the
      Job Monitor for a given job:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the "Show Monitor" button on the Run Controls panel in
        the <a href="Job_Control_content.html">Job Control Window</a>
        (see the image above), or...</li>
      <li>Right click on the specific job entry in the Queue Browser
        then pick "Real-Time Job Monitor" from the pop-up menu:</li>
    </ol>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/queue_browser_ping.png" height="201" width="850"><br>
      <div align="left"><br>
        The Job Monitor window is divided into four panels showing <a href="#Connection_Controls">Connection Controls</a>, <a href="#Messages">Messages</a> relating to the connection and
        data transfer, <a href="#Selecting_Data_Products">Data Controls</a>
        for choosing the data "products" that are to be monitored, and
        the real time <a href="#Plot_Controls">Plots</a>
        themselves.&nbsp; The first three of these panels can be closed
        to yield more screen glass for the plots.&nbsp; Each of these
        sections is described in detail below.<br>
        <h3><a name="Connection_Controls"></a>Connection Controls</h3>
        <p>The Connection Controls panel displays the name of the system
          hosting <i>monitor_server</i>, the TCP port used by <i>guiServer</i>
          to communicate with it, a connection light showing the quality
          of the TCP connection to <i>monitor_server</i>, and a
          real-time display showing data received by the GUI.&nbsp; The
          design of this panel is anticipating a more flexible <i>monitor_server</i>
          scheme - for the moment the controls do not function and the
          plot and connection light are not terribly useful (although
          you can seen data transfers on the plot, which has some
          value).<br>
        </p>
        <div align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/connection.png" height="97" width="850"></div>
        <h3><a name="Messages"></a>Messages</h3>
        <p>The Messages panel shows messages, most of which originate
          with <i>guiServer</i>, that are specific to the Real-Time
          Monitor.&nbsp; Like all DiFX GUI message windows,
          informational messages are displayed in white text, warnings
          are yellow, and errors are red.&nbsp; Standard message window
          controls for clearing items, displaying different message
          types, and limiting the buffer of messages are provided.</p>
        <p align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/messages2.png" height="96" width="850"><i><br>
          </i></p>
        <h5 align="left"><i>Warning: real-time monitor thread has timed
            out after ## seconds of inactivity</i></h5>
        <p>The above message, which sounds rather alarming, is not
          something to be worried about <i>if</i> it occurs after a job
          has completed running.&nbsp; This message originates in the
          monitoring thread that <i>guiServer</i> creates to watch for
          data output from each running job.&nbsp; The nature of <i>monitor_server
          </i>(the process that collects data from DiFX and distributes
          it to monitors such as <i>guiServer</i>) does not in any
          obvious way allow <i>guiServer's</i> thread to know that a
          job is done.&nbsp; To prevent the thread from running forever
          and consuming resources (an idle thread has little
          computational overhead, but the real-time monitor threads
          gobble memory that should be freed), the thread creates a
          timeout modeled on the rate at which it receives real-time
          data from <i>monitor_server</i>.&nbsp; When the timeout is
          exceeded the thread assumes there are no more data and
          terminates itself, in the process producing this message.<br>

      </div>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="Selecting_Data_Products"></a>Data Controls: Selecting
      Data Products</h3>
    <p>The Data Controls Panel allows you to select the "data products"
      you are interested in monitoring during processing.&nbsp; DiFX
      produces a large number of data products, one for each combination
      of possible auto- and cross-correlations, baselines, frequencies,
      polarizations, etc.&nbsp; The Data Controls Panel allows any
      number of these products to be selected for real-time
      monitoring.&nbsp; After parsing the <tt>.input</tt> file
      associated with a job, buttons that correspond to the product
      specifications for that job are provided:<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/dataControls0.png" height="136" width="700"><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">In the above example, the telescopes "MK" and
        "PT" were used for the observation contained in the named <tt>.input</tt>
        file.&nbsp; There were 16 frequencies (channels, bands,
        whatever) observed.&nbsp; Further options for polarizations and
        additional items will be provided in the future (this is a work
        in progress).<br>
        <br>
        To select the products from one or more <b>baselines</b>, click
        on the "Telescope 1" and "Telescope 2" buttons for the antennas
        involved.&nbsp; For the given example, only the "MK-PT" baseline
        is possible.&nbsp; Note that the order of the telescopes is not
        important - as far as the Real-Time Monitor is concerned "MK-PT"
        is identical to "PT-MK".&nbsp; You can select either - the
        monitor will properly match your selection to what is actually
        specified in the <tt>.input</tt> file.<br>
        <br>
        You may also select <b>auto-correlations</b> for antennas by
        selecting the same antenna for both "Telescope 1" and "Telescope
        2". <br>
        <br>
        <b>Frequencies</b> are chosen by selecting one or more frequency
        buttons.<br>
        <br>
        Once enough specifications have been selected to identify one or
        more data products, the "View" and "Apply" buttons will appear,
        along with the total number of products your specifications will
        produce:<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/dataControls1.png" height="219" width="700"><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Note that every combination of your selected
        specifications will be among the data products the real-time
        monitor will display.&nbsp; This may not be what you want - for
        instance, you may be interested in four frequencies for the
        MK-PT baseline, as pictured above, but also in the
        auto-correlation for "MK" at a different frequency.&nbsp; If you
        were to select "MK" (in additon to "PT", which is already
        selected) for "Telescope 2", there would be eight combinations
        that worked (the four selected frequencies for the MK-PT
        baseline and for the MK auto-correlation).&nbsp; If you then
        selected the frequency for the auto-correlation this would add
        another two combinations for a total of ten, five of which you
        weren't actually interested in.<br>
        <br>
        To clean up this mess, the Data Controls Panel provides a table
        with complete information about selected (or all) data products
        through the "View" button.&nbsp; Check boxes in the left-most
        column can be used to add or eliminate individual
        products.&nbsp; Note that the other selection buttons will not
        change to reflect selections through the check boxes, and any
        additional changes to the selection buttons will recreate the
        table (losing any changes to the check boxes that you may have
        made).<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/dataControls2.png" height="247" width="700"><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">Once you are satisfied with your product
        selections, click the "Apply" button.&nbsp; This will transmit
        the product requests, via <i>guiServer</i>, to <i>monitor</i><i>_server</i>.&nbsp;
        Once this is done, the Real-Time Monitor is committed to
        displaying the requested products.&nbsp; <i>Selections </i><i>cannot
          be undone or changed</i><i>!</i>&nbsp; Attempting to do so
        will produce unpredictable and probably unpleasant results.<br>
        <br>
        Once data products are selected, the Real-Time Monitor will plot
        them automatically as data become available.&nbsp; However the
        Monitor does not start the DiFX job - that must be done
        elsewhere.<br>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3><a name="Plot_Controls"></a>Plots Panel<br>
    </h3>
    <p>When running a job, DiFX provides real-time data each time it
      completes processing of an accumulation period.&nbsp; These data
      are plotted for each data product requested as they arrive.&nbsp;
      Depending on what you request for display (see below), columns of
      plots may be drawn for each data product (channel) requested, with
      rows representing accumulation periods.&nbsp; Summaries across
      channels (in a final column) and across accumulation periods (in a
      final row) may also appear.&nbsp; To facilitate comparison among
      plots, all are drawn with the same data limits which are computed
      to accommodate the most extreme data points (which you may not
      even be drawing, depending on you selections).<br>
    </p>
    <h5>Changing Displayed Data</h5>
    <p>The pull-down menu under the "Show" button on the Plots Panel
      allows you to change the content of the plots drawn as well as
      which plots are drawn through a series of check boxes.&nbsp; These
      settings do not alter the data collected - everything is collected
      at all times - so you can change what you are looking at to suit
      your needs at any time.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/showMenu.png" height="506" width="700"><br>
    </p>
    <p align="left">The check boxes under the "Show" menu are described
      below:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><b>All Accumulation Periods</b><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Selecting "All Accumulation Periods" will produce
        a row of plots for each accumulation period collected.&nbsp; A
        column corresponding to each channel will be included.&nbsp;
        Selecting this check box will turn off the "Latest Only" check
        box (see below) if it is on, but the two boxes are not quite
        "radio boxes" in that they can both be off (but they cannot both
        be on).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Latest Only<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">This selection will draw a row of plots for only
        the latest accumulation period.&nbsp; As new data arrive, the
        row will be replaced with new plots representing the new
        data.&nbsp; This produces a far less busy screen of plots than
        with "All Accumulation Periods" selected.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Time Summary<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Time Summary" plots produce a row that represents
        the mean of each channel's data over all accumulation periods
        collected.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Channel Summary<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Channel Summary" plots produce a column
        containing the means of all of the channel data in each
        accumulation period.&nbsp; If both "Channel Summary" and "Time
        Summary are selected a "cross summary" plot will also be
        created.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Phase<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">Selecting "Phase" will produce scatter plots of
        the phase information derived from the visibility data.&nbsp;
        There are 64 phase points in each plot.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Amplitude<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Amplitude" will plot the amplitude of the
        visibility data.&nbsp; There are 64 points in each plot.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Lag<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Lag" plots the FFT of the visibility data (128
        points per plot).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Delay<br>
        </b></p>
      <p align="left">"Delay" computes a single value for delay but
        finding the peak (maximum absolute value) in the lag data and
        computing the offset from the data center using the bandwidth of
        the channel.&nbsp; The delay is plotted as a single line
        (indicating the position of the peak channel) and the computed
        value.<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>Creating an Encapsulated PostScript File</h5>
    <p>The "Save As..." button is used to create an Encapsulated
      PostScript file of the screen content which can be saved wherever
      the user wants using a popup (Java) file chooser.&nbsp; The
      Encapsulated PostScript can be embedded in documents, saved for
      comparison, emailed, or printed.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="" src="images/real_time_monitor/eps.png" height="437" width="700"></div>
    <p><br>
      The saved PostScript representation is (almost) identical to the
      screen (there are some font scaling differences and the background
      is a different color) as it exists at the time the "Save" button
      in the file chooser is pressed.&nbsp; If a job is still running
      while you are selecting a file name, the screen could very well
      change as additional data arrive.&nbsp; This may or may not be
      what you want.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>Viewing Time History With the Mouse Wheel</h5>
    <p>Both the "Time Summary" and "Latest" plots are actually the last
      in a saved history of plots collected from the start of the
      job.&nbsp; You can view this history by spinning the mouse wheel
      over the Plot Panel while these plots are being displayed.&nbsp;
      The "Latest" plot will step through the plots for all collected
      accumulation periods, while the "Time Summary" plot will show the
      data means as they stood after the collection of data for each
      accumulation period (you can watch the signal to noise ratio go up
      as you step later in time and the means are computed from more
      data).<br>
    </p>
    <p>What good is this?&nbsp; It might show you alarming things about
      your data, such as a delay value that is not consistent through
      time.&nbsp; Or it may make outliers in the data more
      obvious.&nbsp; Other than that, it looks kind of slick.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="What_Real-Time_Plots_Can_Tell_You"></a>What Real-Time
      Plots Can Tell You<br>
    </h3>
    <h3><a name="Caveats_and_Warnings"></a>Caveats and Warnings</h3>
    <p>The real-time monitor is a somewhat experimental feature at this
      time.&nbsp; Hopefully any problems it generates will have impacts
      limited to itself, but it may cause the GUI and <i>guiServer</i>
      to be less reliable than otherwise.&nbsp; Which is to say, if it
      crashes things don't be completely shocked.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The nature of <i>monitor_server</i> limits real-time monitoring
      to a single job at a time.&nbsp; The GUI can easily run multiple
      jobs simultaneously, but doing so will completely confuse
      real-time monitoring (the reason for this is that data products
      are identified by <i>monitor_server</i> using only a single
      number, without identifying the .input file source or which job
      the number applies to - this may be fixed in the future) and may
      well cause <i>guiServer</i> to crash.&nbsp; <b>You can avoid
        this problem</b> by running each DiFX job using a different head
      node - i.e. with a different instance of <i>guiServer</i>.&nbsp;
      This capability has not been extensively tested.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The production of real-time data can be computationally
      intensive.&nbsp; Each "product" requested requires the <i>guiServer</i>
      host to run Fourier transforms on the fly as well as cause network
      traffic to transfer the data to the GUI.&nbsp; There is no effort
      made to limit the number of products a user can request, nor has
      an obvious impact on performance been observed in testing, but it
      should be kept in mind that the GUI can be instructed to collect a
      very large number of products for most jobs.&nbsp; Viewing these
      data in real time would probably not be illuminating (they would
      crowd the display with too many plots), but nothing will stop you
      from doing so.&nbsp; Be sensible about this.<br>
    </p>
    Because the Real-Time Monitor is useful only if you are looking at
    it (no data are preserved) and because it consumes computational
    resources on the <i>guiServer</i> host, closing the Real-Time
    Monitor window will cause data collection and transmission to stop.&nbsp;
    It cannot be restarted without restarting the job.<br>
    <br>
    It is not possible to change your mind about what data products you
    are interested in after an initial request has been made - you must
    allow a job to complete.&nbsp; This limitation is an obvious target
    for future enhancements.<br>
    <br>
    The thread the <i>guiServer</i> runs to obtain data from <i>monitor_server</i>
    has no easy way of knowing when the data transfers are
    complete.&nbsp; It has a timeout that terminates the thread after an
    interval based on previous data transfer behavior.&nbsp; In testing
    so far this has worked quite cleanly.<br>
    <h3><a name="Problems_and_Questions"></a>Problems and Questions<br>
    </h3>
    <h5><i>Can I Start Real-Time Monitoring on a Job That is Already
        Running?</i></h5>
    <p>Yes, as long as a job was started with the "Run With Monitor"
      check box selected (see <a href="#Running_a_Job_to_Allow_Real-Time">above</a>), <i>monitor_server</i>
      should have access to that job.&nbsp; It should even be possible
      to monitor a job started by another user, assuming you have access
      to the .input file associated with it.<br>
    </p>
    <h5><i>What Happens if My Job Has More Than One Scan?</i></h5>
    <p>At the moment the real-time monitor is designed to monitor the
      output of a single scan.&nbsp; If a job has more than one scan,
      the monitor will essentially mash them together as if they were
      one.&nbsp; It should work, but labels will likely be confusing
      and/or wrong, and summary plots will make little sense.&nbsp; An
      extension of the current design to handle multiple scans
      gracefully is in the works.<br>
    </p>
    <b><i>monitor_server</i></b><i><br>
      </i><br>

      If you wish to monitor running jobs through the GUI's real-time
      plotting capabilities, the DiFX application <i>monitor_server</i>
      needs to be running.&nbsp; This program provides a TCP server at
      which real-time data from running DiFX processes can be
      obtained.&nbsp; The absence of this process is not usually a
      problem - if you request the real-time plotting it should be
      started automatically.&nbsp; However if you find that real-time
      plotting isn't working, this could be a cause.&nbsp; For details,
      see the<a href="file:///home/jspitzak/difx/difx/applications/gui/trunk/doc/realtime_monitor_content.html"> Real-Time Monitor
        Documentation</a>.&nbsp; Note that at this time real-time
      monitoring is best considered "experimental".<br>
